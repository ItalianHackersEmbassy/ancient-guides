How to make Napalm                              by the Jolly Roger

- Pour some gas into an old bowl, or some kind of container.

- Get some styrofoam and put it in the gas, until the gas won't 
eat anymore. You should have a sticky syrup.

- Put it on the end of something (don't touch it!!). The unused 
stuff lasts a long time!
