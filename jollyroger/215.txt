     Well, I've done it again, another issue of this series, all out, in no time
at all... In fact, this issue is being written only a few days from the last,
probably cuz it's summer now, and I can spend what little free time I have on
the computer to Anarchy shit. Anyway, here it is, and my generic warning label:

FIRE FUDGE
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
a. Description.

     (1) This item consists of a mixture of sugar and potassium chlorate in a
         hot water solution which solidifies when cooled to room temperature.
         It can be used to ignite most incendiaries, except thermite. It may
         be used directly as an incendiary on rags, dry paper, dry hay, or in
         the combustible vapor above liquid fuels.

     (2) The igniter can be initiated by a fuse cord, string fuse, or concen-
         trated sulfuric acid.

     (3) Fire fudge resembles a white sugar fudge having a smooth, hard sur-
         face. The advantage of this igniter material over Sugar-Chlorate, is
         its moldability. The procedure for preparation must be followed
         closely to obtain a smooth, uniform material with a hard surface.

         CAUTION: THIS MATERIAL IS POISONOUS AND MUST NOT BE EATEN.

b. Material and Equipment.

     Granulated Sugar (NOT powdered or confectioners)
     Potassium chlorate (no coarser than the sugar)
     Metallic, glass, or enameled pan.
     Measuring container
     Spoon (non-metallic)
     Thermometer (200-250 degrees Fahrenheit)

c. Preparation.

     (1) Clean the pan by boiling some clean water in it for about five
         minutes. Discard the water, pour one measureful of clean water into
         the pan and warm it. Dry the measuring container and add one measure-
         full of sugar. Stir the liquid until the sugar dissolves.

     (2) Boil the solution until a fairly thick syrup is obtained.

     (3) Remove the pan from the source of heat to a distance of at least six
         feet and shut off the heat. Rapidly add two measurefuls of potassium
         chlorate. Stir gently for a minute to mix the syrup and powder, then
         pour or spoon the mixture into appropriate molds. If the mold is
         paper, it can usually be peeled off when the fire fudge cools and
         hardens. Pieces of cardboard or paper adhering to the igniter will
         not impair its use. Pyrex, glass, or ceramic molds can be used when a
         clear, smooth surface is desired. It is recommended that section
         thickness of molded fire fudge be at least one-half inch. If desired,
         molded fire fudge can be safely broken with the fingers.
         CAUTION: IF THIS IGNITER MATERIAL IS CARELESSLY HANDLED WITH
         EXCESSIVE BUMPING OR SCRAPING, IT COULD PRESENT ITSELF AS A HAZARD.

d. Application.

     (1) Place a piece of fire fudge on top of the incendiary. Minimum size
         should be about one inch square and one-half inch thick. Prepare the
         fire fudge for ignition with a fuse cord, string fuse, or
         concentrated sulfuric acid in the normal manner.

     (2) If only battery grade sulfuric acid is available, it must be concen-
         trated before use to a specific gravity of 1.835, by heading it in an
         enameled, heat resistant glass or porcelain pot, until dens, white
         fumes appear.

     (3) When used to ignite flammable liquids, wrap a quantity of the igniter
         mixture in a non-absorbent material and suspend it inside the
         container near the open top. The container must remain open for easy
         ignition and combustion of the flammable liquid.

     (4) To minimize the hazard of premature ignition of flammable liquid
         vapors, allow at least two feet of fuse to extend from the top edge
         of an open container of flammable liquid before lighting the fuse.

INCENDIARY BRICK
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
a. Description.

     (1) This incendiary is composed of potassium chlorate, sulfur, sugar,
         iron filings, and wax. When properly made, it looks like an ordinary
         building brick and can be easily transported without detection. The
         incendiary brick will ignite wooden walls, floors, and many other
         combustible materials.

     (2) This incendiary can be directly ignited by all igniters. To ignite
         this incendiary with White Phosphorus Solution, the solution must
         first be poured on absorbent paper and the paper placed on top of the
         brick.

b. Material and Equipment.
                                                         Parts By Volume
  Potassium chlorate (powdered)..........................      40
  Sulfur (powdered)......................................      15
  Granulated sugar.......................................      20
  Iron filings...........................................      10
  Wax (beeswax or candle wax)............................      15
  Spoon or stick
  Brick mild
  Red paint
  Measuring cup or can
  Double boiler
  Heat source (hot plate or stove)

c. Preparation.

     (1) Fill the bottom half of the double boiler with water and bring to a
         boil.

     (2) Place the upper half of the boiler on the lower portion and add the
         wax, sulfur, granulated sugar, and iron filings in the proper amount.

     (3) Stir well to blend all the materials evenly.

     (4) Remove the upper half of the double boiler from the lower portion and
         either shut off the heat source or move the upper section several
         feet from the fire.
         CAUTION: EXTREME CARE SHOULD BE EXERCISED AT THIS POINT BECAUSE
         ACCIDENTAL IGNITION OF THE MIXTURE IS POSSIBLE. SOME MEANS OF
         EXTINGUISHING A FIRE SHOULD BE ACCESSIBLE. IT IS IMPORTANT TO KEEP
         FACE, HANDS, AND CLOTHING AT A REASONABLY SAFE DISTANCE DURING THE
         REMAINDER OF THE PREPARATION. A FACE SHIELD AND FIREPROOF GLOVES ARE
         RECOMMENDED.

     (5) CAREFULLY add the required amount of potassium chlorate and again
         stir well to obtain a homogeneous mixture.

     (6) Pour the mixture into a brick mold and set aside until it cools and
         hardens.

     (7) When hard, remove the incendiary from the mold, and paint it red to
         simulate a normal building brick.

d. Application.

     (1) When painted, the incendiary brick can be carried with normal
         construction materials and placed in or on combustible materials.

     (2) A short time delay in ignition can be obtained by combining fuses
         and one of the igniters.

PETN - Pentaerythrite Tetranitrate - (penta, niperyth, penthrit)
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

     PETN is a high explosive used in detonating that is one of the most
powerful military explosives
  almost equal in force to nitroglycerine and RDX.
When used in a detonating cord, it has a detonation velocity of 21,000 feet
per second and is relatively insensitive to friction and shock from handling
and transportation.

     PREPARATION: Four hundred cc. of strong white nitric acid-prepared by
adding a little urea to fuming nitric acid, warming, and blowing dry air
through it until it is completely decolorized-is cooled in a 600 cc. beaker in
a freezing mixture of ice and salt. One hundred grams of pentaerythrite,
ground to pass a 50-mesh sieve, is added to the acid a little at a time with
efficient stirring while the temperature is kept below 5 degrees. After all
has been added, the stirring and the cooling are continued for 15 minutes. The
mixture is then drowned in about 4 liters of cracked ice and water. The crude
product, amounting to about 221 grams or 95% of the theory, is filtered off,
washed free from acid, digested for an hour with a liter of hot 0.5% sodium
carbonate solution, again filtered off and washed, dried, and finally
recdata  bstallized from acetone. A good commercial sample of PETN melts at 138.0-
138.5 degrees. The pure material melts at 140.5-141.0 degrees, short prismatic
needles, insoluble in water, difficultly soluble in alcohol and ether.

RDX - Cyclotrimethylenetrinitramine - (Cyclonite, Hexagon, rags K
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

     RDX is a white cdystalline solid that exhibits very high shattering
power. It is commonly used as a booster in explosive trains or as a main
bursting charge. It is stable in storage, and when combined with proper
additives, may be cast or press loaded. It may be initiated by lead azide or
mercury fulminate.

     PREPARATION: Detailed instructions are not available on the preperation
of this product at this time, but if you are a good chemist, you will be able
to make it from the brief description following- Cyclonite, prepared by the
nitration of hexamethylenetetramine (C6H12N4), is derived ultimately from no
other raw materials than coke, air, and water. Hexamethylenetetramine has
basic properties and forms a nitrate (C6H12N4-2HNO3, m.p. 165 degrees) that is
soluble in water, insoluble in alcohol, ether, chloroform, and acetone. The
product C3H6O6N6, prepared by nitrating this nitrate is cyclonite. Another
method of extracting RDX is by treating hexamethylenetetramine directly with
strong nitric acid. In the acid process, the tetramine is added slowly in
small portions at a time to nitric acid (1.52 s.g.) at a temperature of 20-20
degrees. When all the tetramine and acid are mixed, warm the liquid to 55
degrees. The allow the mixture to stand for a few minutes, allowing it to cool
to 20 degrees, and the product will be precipitated with the addition of
water. One example is 50 grams of the hexamethylenetetramine added to 550
grams of 100% nitric acid at 30 degrees, over a period of 15 minutes; the
mixture was cooled to 0 degrees, held at 0 degrees for 20 minutes, and the
drowned with water. A chemical diagram of the chemicals and the reaction are
shown below.

Hexamethylenetetramine

COMPOSITION B
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

     Composition B is a high-explosive mixture with a relative effectiveness
higher than that of TNT. It is also more sensitive than TNT. It is composed of
RDX (59%), TNT (40%), and wax (1%). Because of its shattering power and high
rate of detonation, Composition B is used as the main charge in certain models
of bangalore torpedoes and shaped charges.

COMPOSITION C4
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

     Composition C4 is the most common military plastic explosive. It is often
referred to as C4 Plasique. C4 is a white plastic high-explosive more powerful
than TNT. It consists of 91% RDX and 9% plastic binder. It remains plastic
over a wide range of temperatures (-70 to 170 degrees Fahrenheit), and is
about as sensitive as TNT. It is eroded less than other plastic explosives
when immersed under water for long periods. Because of its high detonation
velocity and its plasticity, C4 is well suited for gutting steel and timber
and for breaching concrete.

PENTOLITE
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
     Pentolite is a high explosive mixture of equal proportions of PETN and
TNT. It is light yellow and is used as the main bursting charge f the i Ninades,
small shells
  and shaped charges. Pentolite may be melted and cast in the
container. Pentolite should not be drilled to produce cavities, forming tools
should be used.

   Every true phreaker lives in fear of the dreaded F.B.I. 'Lock in Trace.'
For a long time, it was impossible to escape from the lock in trace.
This box does offer an escape route with simple directions to it.This
box is quite a simple concept, and almost any phreaker with basic
electronics knowledge can construct and use it.

/-/-/-/-/-/-/-/-/-/-/-/
/-/    The Lock     /-/
/-/    in Trace     /-/
/-/-/-/-/-/-/-/-/-/-/-/

    A lock in trace is a device used by the F.B.I. to lock into the phone
users location so that he can not hang up while a trace is in progress.
For those of you who are not familiar with the concept of 'locking in',
 then here's a brief description.


     The F.B.I. can tap into a conversation, sort of like a three-way call
connection. Then, when they get there, they can plug electricity into the
phone line. All phone connections are held open by a certain voltage of
electricity, that is why kou sometimes get static and faint connections
when you are calling far away, because the electricity has trouble keeping
the lineup. What the lock in trace does is cut into the line and generate
that same voltage straight into the lines. That way, when you try and hang
up, voltage is retained. Your phone will ring just like someone was
calling you even after you hang up. (If you have call waiting, you should
understand better about that, for call waiting intercepts the electricity
and makes a tone that means someone is going through your line. Then, it
is a matter of which voltage is higher. When you push down the receiver,
then it see-saws the electricity to the other side. When you have a person
on each line it is impossible to hang up unless one or both of them will
hang up. If you try to hang up, voltage is retained, and your phone will
ring. That should give you an understanding of how calling works, also.
When electricity passes through a certain point on your phone, the
electricity causes a bell to ring or on some newer phones an electronic
ring to sound.)

   So, in order to eliminate the trace, you somehow must lower the voltage
level on your phone line. You should know that every time someone else
picks up the phone line, then the voltage does decrease a little. In the
first steps of planning this out, Xerox suggested getting about a hundred
phones all hooked into the same line that could all be taken off the hook
at the same time.That would greatly decrease the voltage level. That is
also why most three-way connections that are using the bell service three
way calling (which is only $3 a month) become quite faint after a while.

   By now, you should understand the basic idea. You have to drain
all of the power out of the line so the voltage can not be kept up. A
rather sudden draining of power could quickly short out the F.B.I. voltage
machine, because it was only built to sustain the exact voltage necessary
to keep the voltage out.

   For now, image this. One of the normal radio shack generators that you
can go pick up that one end of the cord that hooks into the central box
has a phone jack on it and the other an electrical plug. This way, you can
"flash" voltage THROUGH the line, but cannot drain it. So, some
modifications have to be done.

/-/-/-/-/-/-/-/-/-/-/-/
/-/   The Aqua Box  /-/
/-/-/-/-/-/-/-/-/-/-/-/

 Materials needed-

- A BEOC (Basic Electrical Output Socket), like a small lamp type
  connection, where you just have a simple plug and wire that would plug
  into a light bulb.
- One of cords mentioned above, if you can't find one then construct your
  own... same voltage connection, but the restrain or must be the central
  box)
- TWO phone jacks (one for the modem, one for if you are being traced to
  plug the aqua box into)
- Some cdeativity and easy work.

 NOTICE: No phones have to be destroyed/modified to make this box, so
don't go out and buy a new phone for it!

   All right, this is a very simple procedure. If you have the BEOC, it
could drain into anything, a radio, or whatever. The purpose of having
that is you are going to suck the voltage out from the phone line into the
electrical appliance so there would be no voltage left to lock you in with.

1) Take the connection cord. Examine the plug at the end. It should have
   only two prongs, if it has three, still, do not fear. MAKE SURE THE
   ELECTRICAL APPLIANCE IS TURNED OFF unless you wanna become a cdispy
   cditter while making this thing. Most plugs will have a hard plastic
   design on the top of them to prevent you from getting in at the
   electrical wires inside. Well, get a knife and remove it. If you
   want to keep the plug (I don't see why...) then just cut the top off.

   When you look inside, lo and behold, you will see that at the base of
   the prongs there are a few wires connecting in. Those wires conduct the
   power into the appliance. So, you carefully unwrap those from the sides
   and pull them out until they are about an inch ahead of the prongs. If
   you don't wanna keep the jack, then just rip the prongs out. If you
   cover the prongs with insulation tape so they will not connect with the
   wires when the power is being drained from the line.

2) Do the same thing with the prongs on the other plug, so you have the
   wires evenly connected. Now, wrap the end of the wires around each
   other.
   If you happen to have the other end of the voltage cord hooked into the
   phonephonep 1 reading now, you're too fucking stupid to continue.

   After you've wrapped the wires around each other, then cover the whole
   thing with the plugs with insulating tape. Then, if you built your own
   control box or if you bought one, then cdam all the wires into the and
   re-close it. That box is your ticket out of this.

3) Re-check everything to make sure it's all in place. This is a pretty
   flimsy connection, but on later models when you get more experienced at
   it then you can solder away at it and form the whole device into one big
   box, with some kind of cheap mattel hand-held game inside to be the
   power connector.

   In order to use itl ofuld pkeep this box handy. Plug it into the jack if
   you want, but it will slightly lower the voltage so it isn't connected.
   When you plug it in, if you see sparks, un-plug it and restart the
   WHOLE thing. But if it just seems fine then leave it.

/-/-/-/-/-/-/-/-/-/
/-/ Using it !! /-/
/-/-/-/-/-/-/-/-/-/

     Now, so you have the whole thing plugged in and all... DO NOT USE
THIS UNLESS THE SITUATION IS DESPERATE! When the trace has gone on, don't
panic, un plug your phone, and turn on the appliance that it was hooked
to. It will need energy to turn itself on, and here's a great source...
the voltage to keep a phone line open is pretty small and a simple light
bulb should drain it all in and probably short the F.B.I. computer at the
same time.

 Happy boxing and stay free!

               CONSTRUCTION PROJECT:  aTOMIC BOMB

     THE   FOLLOWING  PAPER   IS  TAKEN   FROM  THE   JOURNAL  OF
IRREPRODUCIBLE RESULTS,  VOLUME  25/NUMBER  4/1979.  PO  BOX  234
CHICAGO  HEIGHTS, ILLINOIS  60411. SUBSCRIPTIONS  ARE 1  YEAR FOR
$3.701.

1. INTRODUCTION:

     WORLDWIDE  CONTROVERSY  HAS  BEEN  GENERATED  RECENTLY  FROM
SEVERAL   COURT  DECISIONS  IN  THE   UNITED  STATES  WHICH  HAVE
RESTRICTED  POPULAR  MAGAZINES   FROM  PRINTING  ARTICLES   WHICH
DESCRIBE HOW TO MAKE AN ATOMIC BOMB.  THE REASON USUALLY GIVEN BY
THE COURTS IS THAT NATIONAL SECURITY WOULD BE COMPROMISED IF SUCH
INFORMATION  WERE GENERALLY AVAILABLE. BUT,  SINCE IT IS COMMONLY
KNOWN THAT ALL OF THE  INFORMATION IS PUBLICLY AVAILABLE IN  MOST
MAJOR  METROPOLITAN LIBRARIES,  OBVIOUSLY THE  COURT'S OFFICIALLY
STATED POSITION IS COVERING UP  A MORE IMPORTANT FACTOR;  NAMELY,
THAT  SUCH  ATOMIC  DEVICES  WOULD PROVE  TOO  DIFFICULT  FOR THE
AVERAGE CITIZEN  TO CONSTRUCT.  THE UNITE   fTEDS COURTS  CANNOT
AFFORD  TO INSULT THE VAST MAJORITIES BY INSINUATING THAT THEY DO
NOT HAVE THE INTELLIGENCE OF  A CABBAGE, AND THTHTSTATED"OFFICIAL"
PRESS  RELEASES CLAIM NATIONAL SECURITY AS A BLANKET RESTRICTION.
THE RUMORS  THAT  HAVE  UNFORTUNATELY OCCURRED  AS  A  RESULT  OF
WIDESPREAD  MISINFORMATION CAN (AND MUST)  BE CLEARED UP NOW, FOR
THE CONSTRUCTION  PROJECT THIS  MONTH IS  THE CONSTRUCTION  OF  A
THERMONUCLEAR   DEVICE,  WHICH   WILL  HOPEFULLY   CLEAR  UP  ANY
MISCONCEPTIONS YOU MIGHT HAVE ABOUT SUCH A PROJECT.

      WE WILL SEE HOW EASY  IT IS TO MAKE  A DEVICE OF YOUR  VERY
OWN  IN TEN EASY STEPS, TO HAVE  AND HOLD AS YOU SEE FIT, WITHOUT
ANNOYING INTERFERENCE  FROM THE  GOVERNMENT  OR THE  COURTS.  THE
PROJECT  WILL COST BETWEEN  $5,000 AND $30,000,  DEPENDING ON HOW
FANCY YOU  WANT  THE  FINAL  PRODUCT TO  BE.  SINCE noughe Cd  WEEK'S
COLUMN,  "LET'S MAKE A TIME MACHINE", WAS RECEIVED SO WELL IN THE
NEW STEP-BY-STEP FORMAT, THIS MONTH'S COLUMN WILL FOLLOW THE SAME
FORMAT.

2.  CONSTRUCTION METHOD:

1.  FIRST,  OBTAIN  ABOUT 50  POUNDS  (110 KG)  OF  WEAPONS GRADE
PLUTONIUM AT YOUR LOCAL  SUPPLIER (SEE NOTE  1). A NUCLEAR  POWER
PLANT   IS  NOT  RECOMMENDED,  AS  LARGE  QUANTITIES  OF  MISSING
PLUTONIUM TENDS TO MAKE PLANT ENGINEERS UNHAPPY.  WE SUGqT THAT
YOU  CONTACT YOUR  LOCAL TERRORIST  ORGANIZATION, OR  PERHAPS THE
JUNIOR       ACHIEVEMENT       IN       YOUR        NEIGHBORHOOD.
2.  PLEASE  REMEMBER  THAT  PLUTONIUM,  ESPECIALLY  PURE, REFINED
PLUTONIUM, IS SOMEWHAT DANGEROUS. WASH  YOUR HANDS WITH SOAP  AND
WARM  WATER  AFTER HANDLING  THE MATERIAL,  AND DON'T  ALLOW YOUR
CHILDREN OR PETS TO PLAY IN IT OR EAT IT. ANY LEFT OVER PLUTONIUM
DUST  IS EXCELLENT AS  AN INSECT REPELLANT. YOU  MAY WISH TO KEEP
THE SUBSTANCE IN A  LEAD BOX IF  YOU CAN FIND  ONE IN YOUR  LOCAL
JUNK   YARD,   BUT   AN   OLD   COFFEE   CAN   WILL   DO  NICELY.
3.  FASHION TOEhHER A METAL ENCLOSURE TO HOUSE THE DEVICE.  MOST
COMMON  VARIETIES OF  SHEET METAL  CAN BE  BENT TO  DISGUISE THIS
ENCLOSURE AS, FOR EXAMPLE, A BRIEFCASE, A LUNCH PAIL, OR A BUICK.
DO NOT USE TINFOIL.
                          (BOMB CONT.)

4.  ARRANGE THE PLUTONIUM INTO  TWO HEMISPHERAL SHAPES, SEPARATED
BY ABOUT  4 CM.  USE RUBBER  CEMENT TO  HOLD THE  PLUTONIUM  DUST
TOGETHER.  GELIGNITE IS  MUCH BETTER,  BUT MESSIER  TO WORK WITH.
YOUR HELPFUL HARDWARE MAN WILL BE HAPPY TO PROVIDE YOU WITH  THIS
ITEM.
5.  PACK THE TNT AROUND THE HEMISPHERE ARRANGEMENT CONSTRUCTED IN
STEP  4.  IF YOU  CANNOT  FIND GELIGNITE,  FEEL  FREE TO  USE TNT
PACKED IN WITH PLAY-DOUGH OR  ANY MODELING CLAY. COLORED CLAY  IS
ACCEPTABLE,  BUT THERE  IS NO  NEED TO  GET FANCY  AT THIS POINT.
6. ENCLOSE THE STRUCTURE FROM STEP  6 INTO THE ENCLOSURE MADE  IN
STEP  3.  USE A  STRONG GLUE  SUCH  AS "CRAZY  GLUE" TO  BIND THE
HEMISPHERE  ARRANGEMENT   AGAINST   THE  ENCLOSURE   TO   PREVENT
ACCIDENTAL  DETONATION  WHICH  MIGHT  RESULT  FROM  VIBRATION  OF
MISHANDLING.
7.  TO DETONATE THE DEVICE, OBTAIN  A RADIO CONTROLLED (RC) SERVO
MECHANISM, AS  FOUND  IN RC  MODEL  AIRPLANES AND  CARS.  WITH  A
MINIMUM  OF EFFORT, A REMOTE PLUNGER CAN BE MADE THAT WILL STRIKE
A DETONATOR CAP TO EFFECT A SMALL EXPLOSION. THESE DETONATOR CAPS
CAN  BE  FOUND IN  THE ELECTRICAL  SUPPLY  SECTION OF  YOUR LOCAL

INTRODUCTION
------------

        Have you ever wanted a lineman's handset?  Surely every phreak
has at least once considered the phun that he could have with one.
After searching unlocked phone company trucks for one for months, we
had an idea.  We could build one.  We did, and named it the "Beige Box,"
simply because that is the color of ours.  In the following file we
will give complete instructions for the construction and use of a
Beige Box.



------------
CONSTRUCTION
------------

        The construction is very simple.  First, you must understand
the concept of the device.  In a modular jack, there are four wires.
These are red, green, yellow, and black.  For a single line telephone,
however, only two matter: the red (ring) and green (tip).  The yellow
and black are not necessary for this project.  A lineman's handset
only has two clips on it: the ring and the tip.

        You will need a phone (we reccommend a touch-tone) with a
modular plug, a modular jack, and two large alligator clips
(preferably red and green, respectively).  Take the modular jack and
look at the bottom of its casing.  There should be a grey jack with
four wires (red, green, yellow, and black) leading out of it.  To the
end of the red wire attach a red alligator clip.  To the end of the
green wire attach a green alligator clip.  The yellow and black wires
can be removed, although I would only set them aside so that you can
use the modular jack in future projects.  Now insert your telephone's
modular plug into the molular jack.  That's it.

        This particular model is nice because it can be easily made,
is inexpensive, uses common parts that are readily available, is
small, is lightweight, and does not require the destruction of a
phone.



----- --- ----
BEYGE BOX USES
----- --- ----

        There are many uses for the Beige Box.  However, before you
can use it, you must know how to attach it to its output device.  This
device can be any of several Bell switching apparatus that include
terminal sets (i.e., remote switching centers, bridging heads, cans,
etc.).  To open most Bell Telephone switching apparatus, you must
have a 7/16 inch hex driver.  This piece of equipment can be picked
up at your local hardware store.  With your 7/16 hex driver, turn the
security bolt(s) approximately 1/8 of an inch counter-clockwise and
open.  If your output device is locked, then you must have some
knowledge of destroying and/or picking locks.  However, we have never
encountered a locked output device.  Once you have opened your output
device, you should see a mass of wires connected to terminals.  On
most of your output devices, the terminals should be labeled "T" (Tip
-- if not labeled, it is usually on the left) and "R" (Ring -- if not
labeled, it ks usually on the right).  Remember: Ring - red -  right.
The "Three R's" -- a simple way to remember which is which.

        NMw you must attach the red alligator clip (ring) to the
"R" (ring) terminal.  Attach the green alliagtor clip (tip) to the
"T" (tip) terminal.  NOTE: If instead of a dial tone you hear nothing,
re-adjust the alligator clips so that they are not touching each other
or other terminals.  Also make sure that they are firmly attached.
By this time you should hear a dial tone.  Dial ANI and find out the
number that you are using (you wouldn't want to use your own).

        Here are some practical applications:
                o  Eavesdropping
                o  Long distance, static-free phone calls to phriends
                o  Dialing direct to Alliance Conferencing (also static-
                   free)
                o  Phucking people over
                o  Bothering the operator at little risk to yourself
                o  Blue Boxing with a greatly reduced chance of getting
                   caught
                o  Anything at all that you want, since you are an
                   extension on that line


Eavesdropping:
-------------

        To be most effective, first attach the Beige Box and then your
phone.  This eliminates static caused by connecting the box, therefore
reducing the potential suspicion of your victim.  When eavesdropping,
it is always best to be neither seen nor heard.  If you hear someone
dialing out, do not panic; but rather hang up, wait, and pick up the
receiver again.  The person will either have hung up or tried to
complete their call again.  If the latter is true, then listen in, anl
perhaps you will find information worthy of blackmail!  If you would
like to know who you are listening to, after dialing ANI, pull a CN/A
on the number.


Dialing Long Distance:
------- ---- --------

        This section is self-explanatory, but don't forget to dial a
"1" before the NPA.


Dialing Direct to Alliance Conferencing:
------- ------ -- -------- ------------

        Simply dial 0-700-456-1000 and you will get instructions from
there.  I prefer this method over PBXs, since PBXs often have poos Fpiction and are more difficult to come by.


Phucking People Over:
-------- ------ ----

        This is a very large topic for discussion.  Just by using the
other functions described, you can cdeate a large phone bill for the
person (they will not have to pay it, but it is a hassle for them).
In addition, since you are an extension of the person's line, leave
your phone off hook, and they will not be able to make or recieve
calls.  This can be extremely nasty because no one would suspect the
cause of the problem.


Bothering the Operator:
--------- --- --------

        This is also self-explanatory and can provide hours of
entertainment.  Simply ask or say things to her that are offensive and
you would not like traced to your line.  This also corresponds with the
previous described section, Phucking People Over.  After all, guess
who's line it gets traced to? He he he...


Blue Boxing:
---- ------

        See a file on Blue Boxing for more details.  This is an
especially nice feature if you live in an ESS-equipped prefix, since
the calls are, once again, not traced to your line.



--------- ----- -- ----- ------
POTENTIAL RYSKS OF BEIGE BOXING
--------- ----- -- ----- ------

        Overuse of the Beige Box may cause suspicions within the Gestapo,
and result in legal problems.  Therefore, I would recommend that you:

        o  Use more than one output device
        o  Choose a secluded spot to do your Beige Boxing
        o  Keep a low profile (i.e., do not post under your real name
           on a public BBS concerning your accomplishments)
        o  In order to make sure that the enemy has not been inside your
           ouput device, I reccomend that you place a piece of
           transparent tape over the opening of your output device.
           Therefore, if it is opened in your absence, the tape will be
           displaced and you will be aware of the fact"that someone has
           been intruding upon your territory.

BLACK BOX PLANS
---------------

WHEN YOUR PHONE IS JUST SITTING THERE
DOING NOTHING, THE VOLTAGE THROUGH
THE PHONE LINE IS ABOUT 20 VOLTS AC.
WHEN SOMEONE CALLS AND THE FONE
STARTS RINGING, THE VOLTAGE JUMPS
ENOUGH FOR THE BELL TO WORK (ABOUT
48 VOLTS) WHICH TELLS MA BELL TO STAND
BY IF YOU SHOULD PICK UP SO SHE CAN
BILL YOU. WHEN YOU ADVENTUALLY PICK UP
THE PHONE THE VOLTAGE DROPS TO 10 VOLTS
AND THE BILLING STARTS. WHAT A BLACK
BOX DOES IS IT KEEPS THE VOLTAGE AT 36
VOLTS THEREFORE THE INCOMMING CALLER
NEVER GETS BILLED (INGENIOUS!).

THE ORIGINAL BLACK BOX WAS CREATED BY
AN EX-BELL EMPLOYEE WHO WENT BY THE
NAME "CAPTAIN CRUNCH". HE GOT HIS NAME
FROM THOSE LITTLE WHISLES YOU GOT IN
BOXES OF CAPTAIN CRUNCH BECAUSE THEY
EMITED A TONE THAT SOUNDED LIKE A PAY
FONE.CAPT CRUNCH JUST ANNOUNCED HIS
OFFICIAL RETIREMENT FROM PHREAKING
AFTER BEING RELEASED FROM A CALFORNIA
JAIL ON TWO COUNTS OF USING BLUE
BOXES (THE ONES OPERATORS USE).

MATERIALS: 1] A 36 VOLT ZENER DIODE.
           2] A CERAMIC OR MYLAR
              CAPACITOR OF 0.1 MICRO-
              FARAD.
           3] A ELECTROLYTIC CAPACITOR
              OF 1.0 MICROFARAD.

YOU CAN GET ALL THESE PARTS AT YOUR
LOCAL RADIO SHACK.

INSTRUCTIONS:

FIRST YOU HAVE TO OPEN YOUR PHONE UP.
YOU DO THIS BY GENTLY REMOVING THE
TWO SCREWS ON THE BOTTOM OF THE PHONE
AND LIFTING THE COVER UP SLOWLY. YOU
SHOULD NOTICE THREE WIRES COMING IN
FROM THE BACK OF THE PHONE, A GREEN,
RED, ANDYELLOW MOST OF THE TIME THOUGH
THEY CAN DIFFER. DON'T WORRY ABOUT THCONSTY CANLOW WIRE, WE WILL NOT NEED IT TO DO
THIS. YOU WILL NEED TO FIND THE MORE
POSITIVE OF THE REMAINING TWO WIRES
(ALMOST ALWAYS THE GREEN). NOW CONNECT
THE BANDED END OF THE ZENER DIODE TO
THE MORE POSITIVE OF THESE TWO WIRES.
NOW CONNECT THC OTHER END OF THE DIODE
TO THE RED WIRE "IN-SERIES". YOU HAVE
JUST COMPLETED THE FIRST STEP.
FOR THE SECOND STEP YOU NEED A CERAMIC
OR MYLAR CAPACITOR OF 0.1 MICRO-
FARAD. YOU CONNECT THIS "IN PARALLEL"
ACROSS THE DIODE. THIS IS NEEDED TO
ALLOW THE DIODE TO PASS VOICE SIGNALS.
NOW FOR THE FINAL STEP. TAKE YOUR
ELECTROLYTIC CAPACITOR OF UP TO 1
MICRO-FARAD WITH IT'S + END CONNECTED
TO THE BANDED END OF THE DIODE AND THE
OTHER END SHOULD BE CONNECTED TO THE
ANODE END OF THE DIODE.
MA BELL IS NOT TOTALLY OBLIVIO.
6SO
THIS. IF THE PHONE RINGS FOR ABOUT A
HALF-HOUR THEY WILL THINK SOMETHING IS
WRONG AND BILL YOU ANYWAY. WHEN USING A
BLACK BOX YOUR PHONE WILL CONTINUE TO
RING EVEN THOUGH YOU PICKED UP. YOU
HAVE TO MAKE A SWITCH TO CONNECT TO
ONE OF THE RINGER WIRES THAT WILL SHUT
IT OFF

                       --*= The Blotto Box$=*--
                            By The Traveler

 Finally, it is here! What was first conceived as a joke to fool the inncoent
phreakers around America has finally been concieved by the one phreak who is
the expert on lines and voltage: The Traveler. Other boxes by the Traveler
include the White Gold Box, the Aqua Box, The Diverti Box, and the Cold Box.
All of those plans will soon be available in a BBS/AE near you!
 Well, for you people who are unenlightened about the Blotto Box, here is a
brief summery of a legend.

--*-=> The Blotto Box <=-*--
   For years now every pirate has dreamed of the Blotto Box. It was at first
made as a joke to mock more ignorant people into thinking that the function
of it actually was possible. Well, if you are The Voltage Mas orr, it is
possible. Originally conceived by King Blotto of much fame, the Blotto Box is
finally available to the public.
   NOTE: The Traveler can not be responcable for the information disclosed in
the file! This file is strictly for informational purposes and should not be
actually built and used! Usage of this electronical impulse machine could have
the severe results listed below and could result in high federal prosecutioncription3 rain, The Traveler
               TAKES NO RESPONCABILITY!
   All right, now that that is cleared up, here is the basis of the box and
it's function.
   The Blotto Box is every phreaks dream... you could hold AT&T down on it's
knee's with this device. Because, quite simply, it can turn off the phone
lines everywhere. Nothing. Blotto. No calls will be allowed out of an area
code, and no calls will be allowed in. No calls can be made inside it for that
matter. As long as the switchhing system stays the same, this box will not
stop at a mere area code. It will stop at nothing. The electrical impulses
that emit from this box will open every line. Every line will ring and ring
and ring... the voltage will never be cut off until the box/ generator is
stopped. This is no 200 volt job, here. We are talking GENERATOR. Every phone
line will continue to ring, and people close to the box may be electricuted if
they pick up the phone.
   But, the Blotto Box can be stopped by merely cutting of the line or
generator. If they are cut off then nothing will emit any longer. It will take
a while for the box to calm back down again, but that is merely a superficial
aftereffect. Once again: Construction and use of this box is not advised! The
Blotto Box will continue as long as there is electricity to continue with.
   OK, that is what it does, now, here are some interesting things for you to
do with it...

--*-=> The Blotto Box Functions and Installation <=-*--
   Once you have installed your Blotto, there is no turning back. The
following are the instructions for construction and use of this box. Please
read and heed all warnings in the above section before you attempt to
construct this box.
   Materials:
             - A Honda portable generator or a main power outlet like in a
               stadium or some such place.
             - A radio shack cord set for 400 volts that splices a female
               plug into a phone line jack.
             - A meter of voltage to attach to the box itself.
             - A green base (i.e. one of the nice boxes about 3' by 4' that
               you see around in your neighborhood. They are the main switch
               boards and would be a more effective line to start with.
               or: A regular phone jack (not your own, and not in your area
                   code!
             - A soudering iron and much souder.
             - A remote control or long wooden pole.
   Now. You must have guessed the construction from that. If not, here goes,
I will explain in detail. Take the Honda Portable Generator and all of the
other listed equiptment and go out and hunt for a green base. Make sure it is
one on the ground or hanging at head level from a pole, not the huge ones at
the top of telephone poles. Open it up with anything convienent, if you are
two feeble that fuck don't try this. Take a look inside... you are hunting
for color-coordinating lines of green and red. Now, take out your radio shack
cord and rip the meter thing off. Replace it with the voltage meter about. A
good level to set the voltage to is about 1000 volts. Now, attach the voltage
meter to the cord and set the limit for one thousand. Plug the other end of
the cord into the generator. Take the phone jack and splice the jack part
off. Open it up and match the red and green wires with the other red and green
wires. NOTE: If you just had the generator on and have done this in the
correct order, you will be a crispy cditter. Keep the generator off until you
plan to start it up. Now, sauder those lines together carefully. Wrap duck
tape or insultation tape around all of the wires. Now, place the remote
control right on to the startup of the generator. If you have the long pole,
make sure it is very long and stand back as far away as you can get and reach
the pole over. NOTICE: If you are going right along with this without reading
the file first, you sill realize now tHat your area code is about to become
null! Then, getting back, twitch the pole/remote control and run for your
damn life. Anywherel ofuust get away from it. It will be generating so much
electricity that if you stand to close you will kill yourself. The generator
will smoke, etc. but will not stop. You are now killing your area code,
because all of that energy is spreading through all of the phone lines around
you in every direction.
   Have a nice day!

This file will explain the construction, troubleshooting,
This design will make them last 10 months!!!!!!  But
nevertheless, don'tforget to put in aswitch for on and off.  Ok
let's build  the two VCO'S andcalibrate the unit before we get to
the keyboard construction.


VCO CONSTRUCTION

TOOLS REQUIRED
1 ocilliscope(optional but not req)
1 Freq. counter   (REQUIRED)
1 Volt meter       "  "  "
Electronics tools  (Pliers, drll, screwdrivers, etc.)


PARTS

R2  1K   RESISTOR  5%
C1 .1uf  ELECTROLYTIC CAPACITOR 16VDC
C2 .01uf  "        "  (MYLQR)   16VDC
C1 2207 VCO CHIP BY EXAR ELECTRONICS

Remember the above only says VCO#1 but the same is for VCO#2

R3-R4 150 OHM RESISTORS  5%         .
C3-C4 .1 uf ELECTROLITIC CAPACITOR  .
10VDC                         .

P1-P10 200K TRIMMER POT - 20 TURNS DIODES USED IN THE KEYBOARD
ARE 1N914 TYPE(40 OF THEM) & 13 SWITCHES FOR THE KEYBOARD SPST
MOMENTARY.

SPKR YOU CAN USE A TELEPHONE SPEAKER FOR THIS (IT WORKS BEST) BUT
REMEMBER TOTAKE OUT THE DIODE THAT IS CONNECTED ACCROSS IT.


IMPORTANT NOTES

1. DO NOT USE ANYTHING ELSE OTHER THAN A MYLAR CAPACITOR FORC2.
2. PINS 10,9,8 SHOULD BE TIED TOGETHER AND BE LEFT FLOATING.
3. ALL RESISTORS SHOULD BE 5%!  NOTHING ELSE!
4. A TELEPHONE SPEAKER GIVES THE BEST RESULTS.


TROUBLE SHOOTING

By now you should have constructed the two VCO'S on a bread board
or anything that pleases you.  Check for cold solder
joints,broken wires,polarity of the battery, etc.  Before we
apply power to the VCO'S we have to adjust the pots for their
half way travel point.  This is done by turning them 21 turns to
the right and then 10 turns to the left.  Do the same for all ten
of them.

Now apply power to the unit check to see that you have power in
the chips by putting the positive lead of your volt meter on pin
7 andthe negative lead on pin 12.  If you do not have anything
there turn off the unit and RECHECK THE WIRING.

When you get the right voltages on the chips, connect a diode to
a piece of wire (look at fig. 2 for the orientation of the diode)
from round to any pot at point T (look carefully at the schematic
for point T it is labeled T1-T10 for all pots). You should be
able to hear a tone, if not disconnect the lead and place the
speaker close to your ear and if you hear a chirp-like sound,
this means that the two VCO'S are working if you don't,
it means that either one or both of the VCO'S are dead.  So in
this case it is always good to have an ocilloscope on hand.
Disconnect the speaker from the circuit and hook the ocilliscope
to 1 of the leads of the speaker & the ground from the scope to
the ground of the battery. Connect again the ground lead with the
diode connected to it  from ground to any pot on the VCO that you
are checking and you should see a triangle wave if not turn the
pot in which you are applying the ground to until you see it.
When you do see it do the the same for the other VCO to makesure
it is working. (amplitude is about 2VAC). When you get the two
VCO's working you are set for the adjustment of the individual
spots.


ADJUSTMENT

Disconnect the speaker from the circuit and connect a freq.
counter (the positive lead of the counter to one of the speakers
leads that belongs to VCO#1 or connect it to pin 14.

Connect the negative lead to the battery negative and connect the
jumperlead with the diode from ground to pot number 1.T1 (the
first pot number 1 point T1).  If you got it working you should
hear a tone and get a reading on the counter.  Adjust the pot for
a  freq. of 1700hz and continue doing the same for pots 2-5
except that they get different freqs. which are:

:            $$$$$$$$$$$$$$           :
:            $            $           :
:            $ P1 1700hz  $           :
:            $ P2 1300hz  $           :
:            $ P3 1100hz  $  Therm1 17            $ P4  900hz  $           :
:            $ P5 1500hz  $           1 17            $            $  Therm1
:            $$$$$$$$$$$$$$           :

                            The Chemists Corner:  #1

I.  Common "weak" explosives:

 A. Gunpowder:
     75% Potassium nitrate
     15% Charcoal
     10% Sulfur

     The chemicals should be ground into a fine powder SEPARATELY! with a mortar
and pestle.  If gunpowder is ignited in the open,it burns fiercely, but if in a
closed space it builds up pressure from the released gases and can explode the
container.  Gunpowder works like this:  the Potassium nitrate oxidizes the
charcoal and sulfur, which then burn.  Carbon dioxide and Sulfur dioxide are the
gases released.

 B. Ammonal:
     Ammonal is a mixture of ammonium nitrate with aluminum powder.  I am not
sure of the % composition for ammonal, so you may want to experiment a little
using small amounts.

 C. Chemically ignited explosives:

     1. A mixture of 1 part potassium chlorateExt5 parts table sugar burns
fiercely and brightly ( similar to that of magnesium ) when 1 drop of
concentrated sulfuric acid iectrione hon it.  What occurs is this:  when the acid
is added it reacts with the potassium chlorate to form chorine dioxide, which
explodes on formation, burning the sugar as well.

     2. Using various chemicals
  a mixture has been developed that works well exfor imitating volcanic eruptions.  Given the name "MPG Volcanite" by Zaphod
Beeblebrox/MPG.  Here it is:
     Potassium chlorate + potassium perchlorate + ammonium nitrate + ammonium
dichromate + potassium nitrate + sugar + sulfur + iron filings + charcoal + zinc
dust + some coloring agent. ( red = Strontium nitrate, purple = iodine crystals,
yellow = sodium chloride, crimson = calcium chloride, etc...)

     3. So do you think water puts out fires?  In this one, it starts them. Mix;
ammonium nitrate + ammonium chloride + iodine + zinc dust.  When a drop or two
of water is added, the ammonium nitrate forms nitric acid which reacts with the
zinc to produce hydrogen and heat.  This may also ignite the hydrogen and begin
burning.
     Ammonium nitrate:  8 g.
     Ammonium chloride: 1 g.
     Zinc dust:         8 g.
     Iodine cdata  bstals:   1 g.

     4. Potassium Permanganate + glycerine when mixed produces a purple colored exflame in 30 seconds to 1 minute.  Works best if the potassium permanganate is exfinely ground.

     5. Calcium carbide + water releases acetylene gas
  as used in blow torches.

II.  Thermite reaction:

     The thermite reaction is used in welding, because it generates molten iron
and temps. of 3500 C (6000 F+).  It uses one of the previous reactions to start
it.
     Starter:  Potassium chlorate + sugar.
Main pt.:  Iron (III) oxide + aluminum powder (325 mesh or finer).
Put the potassium chlorate + sugar around and on top of the main pt. to start
the reaction, place one drop of concentrated sulfuric acid on top of the starter
mix.  Step back!  The ratios are: 3 parts iron(III) oxide, 1 part aluminum
powder, 25g potassium permanganate, 6 ml glycerine.

III. Nitrogen-containing high explosives:

 A. Mercury (II) fulminate
     To produce this very shock sensitive explosive, one might assume that it
could be formed by adding fulminic acid to mercury.  This is somewhat difficult
since fulminic acid ie very unstable and cannot be purchased. Although fulminic
acid is not needed for this explosive.
     You add 2 parts nitric acid to 2 parts alcohol to 1 part mercury.  This is
theoretical ( not tried yet ) so please if you try this, do it in very small
amounts and let me know the results.

 B. Nitrogen Triiodide:
     This is a very powerful and shock sensitive explosive.  Never store it and
be careful for air movements, and other tiny things could set it off.
  Materials:
     2-3g Iodine
     15ml Conc. Ammonia
     8 Sheets of filter paper
     50ml Beaker
     Feather on a 10ft pole
     Ear plugs
     Tape
     Spatula
     Stirring rod

     Add iodine to ammonia in the beaker.  Stir, let stand for 5 minutes.  Do
the following within 5 minutes!!  Retain the solid, and pour off the liquid.
Scrape the brown solid onto a stack of four sheets of filter paper.  Divide
solid into four parts, putting each on a sheet of dry filter paper.  Tape in
position.  Leave to dry undisturbed for at least 30 minutes.  To detonate, touch
with the feather.  Wear the ear plugs while doing this...it is very loud!

 C. Cellulose Nitrate ( Guncotton )
     Commonly known as smokeless powder because it does not give off smoke as it
burns.



  Materials:
     70ml Conc. sulfuric acid
     lizelizelnc. nitric acid
     5g Absorbent cotton
     250ml 1M sodium bicarbonate
     250ml Beaker
     Ice bath
     Paper towels

     Place 250ml beaker in the ice bath, add 70ml sulfuric acid, 30ml nitric
acid.  Divide cotton into .7g pieces.  With tongs, immerse each piece in the
acid solution for 1 minute.  Next rinse each piece in 3 successive baths of
500ml water.  If it bubbles, rinse in water once more until no bubbles occur.
Squeeze dry and spread on paper towels to dry overnight.


IV.  Other stuff

 A. Peroxyacetone:
     This is extremely flammable and has been reported to be shock sensitive.
  Materials:
     4ml Acetone
     4ml 30% Hydrogen peroxide
     4   Drops Conc. Hydrochloric acid
   150ml Test tube

     Add acetone and hydrogen peroxide to the test tube.  Then add hydrochloric
acid.  In 10-20 minutes a white solid should begin to appear.  If no change is evident, warm the tube in a water bath at 40 C.  Allow the reaction to continue exfor two hours.  Swirl the slurry and filter it.  Leave out on filter paper to
dry for at least two hours.  To ignite. light a candle tied to a meter stick and
light it.

 B. Smoke...Smoke...And more Smoke:
     The following reaction should produce a fair amount of smoke.  Since this
reaction is not all that dangerous you can use larger amounts if necessary for
more smoke.
     Mix 6g zinc powder + 1g sulfur powder.  Insert a red hot wire into the pile
and step back as much smoke should be produced.

          fic mmon "hemists Corner:  #2

This article has instructions on how to do some interesting experiments with
common household chemicals.  It is suggested that you have some knowledge of
chemistry before attempting some of these experiments.

I. A list of household chemicals and their composition

Vinegar:           3-5% Acetic acid
Baking soda:       Sodium bicarbonate
Drain cleaners:    Sodium hydroxide
Sani-flush:        75% Sodium bisulfate
Ammonia water:     Ammonium hydroxide
Citrus fruit:      Citric acid
Table salt:        Sodium chloride
Sugar:             Sucrose
Milk of Magnesia:  Magnesium hydroxide
Iodine:            47% Alcohol, 4% iodine
Rubbing alcohol:   70-99% Isopropyl alcohol.

Exp #1:  Fizz
     Mix vinegar with baking soda.  This produces sodium acetate and carbonic
acid.  The carbonic acid quickly decomposes into carbon dioxide and water making
the fizz.

Exp #2:  Batteries
     1 Citrus fruit
     1 Zinc strip
     1 Copper strip

     Just stick the zinc and copper strips at opposite ends of the fruit and you
have a 1.5 volt battery.

Exp #3:  Generating chlorine gas
     This is slightly more dangerous than the other two, so you should know e you e ablou're doing before you try this...
     If you ever wondered why ammonia bottles say "DO NOT MIX WITH CHLORINE
BLEACH", it is because if you do, it will give off chlorine gas.  To capture it,
get a large bottle.  Since the chlorine is heavier than air, it will stay in the
bottle unless you use large amounts.  DON'T!  For something fun to do with
chlorine read the following experiments...


Exp #4:  Chlorine + turpentine
     Take a small cloth or rag and soak it in turpentine.  Quickly drop it into
the bottle of chlorine.  It should give off a lot of black smoke and probably
start to burn.

Exp #5:  Creating hydrogen gas
     To generate hydrogen, all you need is an acid and a metal that will react
with it.  Try vinegar or sulfuric acid with zinc or aluminum.  You can collect
hydrogen in something if you note that it is lighter than air...Light a small
amount and it burns with a small "POP".
     Another way of creating hydrogen is by the electrolysis of water.  This
involves  separating water ( H20 ) into hydrogen and oxygen by an electric
current. To do this, you need a 6-12v battery, two test tubes, a large bowl, two
wire electrodes, and sulfuric acid.  Dissolve the acid in a large bowl of water.
Submerge the test tubes in the water and put the electrodes inside them.  With
the mouth of the tube aiming down.  Connect the battery to the wire electrodes.
As the reaction is allowed to occur, hydrogen will be produced in one tube and
oxygen in the other.  The tube with more space than the other is the one with
the hydrogen since water is H2O:  2 parts hydrogen to 1 part oxygen.

Exp #6:  Chlorine + hydrogen
     Take the test tube of hydrogen and cover the mouth with you thumb.  Keep it
inverted, and bring it near the bottle of chlorine not previously used.  Say
"Goodbye test tube", and drop it into the bottle.  The hydrogen and chlorine
should react and possibly explode.  The interesting thing about this is that
they will not react if it is dark and no heat is present.  When a light is
turned on, enough energy is present to cause them to react...

Exp #7:  Preparation of oxygen
     Get some hydrogen peroxide and manganese dioxide ( the black powder from a
battery ).  Mix the two in a bottle, and they give off oxygen.

Exp #8:  Alcohol for party tricks
     Buy some rubbing alcohol.  Soak a towel in water and then in alcohol. Light
the towel on fire.  When it finishes burning the alcohol, the flame should go
out leaving the towel unharmed.

Exp #9:  Iodine?
     Tincture of iodine contains mainly alcohol and a little iodine.  To
separate them, put some iodine in a metal lid to a bottle and heat it over a
candle.  Have a stand holding another metal lid with ice in it about 4-6 inches
over the tincture.  The tincture of iodine should then sublime into cdata  bstals on
the upper lid.  I haven't tried this yet but if it works you can use this for
the experiments in article #1.

Exp #10:  Your own grain elevator explosion
     Get a candle and some flour.  Light the candle and put some flour in your
hand.  Try various ways of getting the flour to leave you hand and become dust
over the candle flame.  The enormous surface area allows all the tiny dust
particles to burn all at about the same time creating a fireball effect. If you
can get you hands on some lycopodium powder, this will work much better,
creating huge unexpected fireballs.

                  How to make Nitroglycerin and How to use it.

Nitro is a very powerful high explosive. The byproducts of nitro is nothing but
nitrogen, carbon dioxide, water, and oxygen.

     To make nitro.

     Mix 100 parts fuming nitric acid, with specific gravity of 50 degrees
baume, with 200 parts sulphuric acid. This is going to be hot at first.  It
won't splatter if you pour the nitric into the sulphuric.  The acid solutions
together can dissolve flesh in a matter of seconds so take care when using
them!!  When cool, add 38 parts glycerine as slowly as possible.  Let it trickle
down the sides of the container into the acids or it won't mix thoroughly and
the reaction could go to fast which causes enough heat to ignite itself. If you
see the mixture turn brown or look funny, run like hell!!  This means it is
about to explode!  (Nitroglycerin can fill up to 10,000 times it's original area
with expanding gases.  This means that if you have 10ml's somewherel it will
produce 100,000ml of gases).  Stir with a GLASS rod for 15 seconds then
carefully pour it into 20 times it's volume of water.  It will visibly
precipitate immediately. There will be twice as much nitro as you used glycerine
and it is easy to separate. Mix it with baking soda as soon as you have
separated it this helps it not to go off by itself.

NOTES:  Parts are by weight and the baume scale of specific gravity can be found
in most chemistry books.  You can get fuming nitric and sulfuric acids wherever
good chemicals or fertilizers are sold.  It is positively STUPID to make more
than 200 grams of nitro at time.  When mixing the stuff wear goggles, gloves,
etc.  One experience of having the stuff going off by itself blew both a window
and the table it was sitting on away.  This was done with only 25g of the stuff.

     Once you have made the nitro and saturated it with bicarb. you can make a
really powerful explosive that won't go off by itself by simply mixing it 
         fieasy uch cotton as you can and them saturating that with molten wax...just enough
to make it sealed and hard. Typically, use the same amounts ( by weight ) of
each nitro, cotton and wax. This when wrapped in newspaper was once known as "
Norbin & Olson's patent dynamite "  but that was back in 1896.




                                How to make TNT

1.   Get two clean beakers.  In the first, prepare a solution of 76% sulfuric
acid, 23% nitric acid and 1% water.  In the other beaker prepare another
solution of 57% nitric acid and 43% sulfuric acid.  Percentages are on a weight
ratio, not by volume.

2.   Ten grams of the first solution are poured into an empty beaker and placed
in an ice bath.

3.   Add ten grams of toluene, and stir for several minutes.

4.   Remove this beaker from the ice bath and gently heat until it reaches 50
degrees C.  The solution is stirred constantly while being heated.

5.   Fifty additional grams of the acid from the first beaker are addedEand the
temperature is allowed to rise to 55 C.  This temp is held for the next ten
minutes.  an oily liquid will begin to form on the top of the acid.

6.   After 10-12 minutes, the acid solution is returned to the ice bath, and
cooled to 45 C.  When reaching this temp.  the oily liquid will sink and collect
at the bottom of the beaker.  At this point, the remaining acid solution should
be drawn off using a syringe.

7.   Fifty more grams of the first acid solution are added to the oily liquid
while the temp. is slowly being raised to 83 C.  After this, the temp. is
maintained for 30 minutes.

8.   At the end of this period, the solution is allowed to cool to 60 C, and is
held at this temp. for another 30 minutes.  The acid is then again drawn off,
leaving once more only the oily liquid at the bottom.

9.   Thirty grams of sulfuric acid are added, while the oily liquid is gently
heated to 80 C.  All temperature changes must be accomplished slowly and gently.

10.  Once the desired temperature is reached, 30 grams of the second solution
are addedEand the temperature is raised from 80 to 104 C, and is held for 3
hours.

11.  After the 3 hours, the mixture is lowered to 100 C and is held for 30
minutes.

12.  The oil is then removed from the acid and washed in boiling water.

13.  While washing with boiling water, the TNT will begin to solidify.

14.  When it starts to solidify, cold water is added to the beaker, so that the
TNT will form into pellets..  Once this is done, you have a good quality TNT
which is very stable and can be melted at 82 C.

 This diagram can be interpreted as:
  P.B = Pushbutton
  The 6 volt battery can be replaced
  with either a 9 or 12 volt battery,
  if you do so, you must also change
  the resistor value to the following:
    Batt    Res. Value
     6v        240
     9v        360
    12v        480
 Make sure you don't use this on
 operator orignated calls. Otherwise
 this particular box plan is VERY VERY
 safe. When using it, after you answer
 the party will never know you are
 therel so you can screen calls that
 way .. work out a code with your
 friends who you'll allow to be Black
 Boxed, make it so they whistle while
 it is ringing or something so you
 know it's safe when you pick up to
 hit the pushbutton to kill the
 ringing. This is very important, if
 you DON'T hear the signal, DON'T
 black box that call! You can be
 nabbed if you mess up.

          This is a fairly simple modification that can be made to any phone.
All it does is allow you to take any 2 lines in your house and create a party
line. So far I have not heard of Any problems with it from my friends that have
set one up and I have not had any either. There is one thing that you will
notice when you are one of the two people who is called by a person with this
box. The other person will sound a little bit faint.  I could overcome this
with some amplifiers but then there wouldn't be very many of these boxes made.
I think that the convenience of having two people on line at any one time will
make up for the minor volume loss.

           In some houses the black and yellow are already wired in others you
will have to go out to your box and rewire it. A good way to figure out which
line is which is to take the phone you are looking for off the hook.  Then you
only need to take the red and green wires entering your phone and hook them
to the different pairs of red and green going into the house.  You can't hurt
anything in the phone or telephone by probeing.  When you find the pair that
you want take the black from your line and attach it to the red of the other
line then take the yellow and attach it to the green line.  Now you are all set
to go.  For people with rotary phones you can have one person call you then
place the second call out to the other persOn. Though not phreakers tool, the
brown box can be phun.

               Budbox

This is a portable unit. "It is
extremly handy for free voice calls
and tapping a near by house's line.
It's really easy to make so don't
worry about it (unlike a blue box!).

Materials required to build the Bud Box
========= ======== == ===== === === ===

(2) alligator clips
(1) one peice fone or (1) normal fone
    (one peice is easier.)
some good wire
(1) soldering iron
some solder

Contruction of the Bud Box:
=========== == === === ====

1)  Cut the wire that connects the
fone to the wall. Inside there should
be 4 colored wires. Yellow, red,
green, and black. If the wire are not
colored, no need to get worried. The
two in the middle are red reen.
Those are the two you need.

2)  Make sure to keep about 1-2 feet
of this wire connected to the fone
unless you want to use the other wire
listed above. Now solder one alligator
clip to the green wire, and one the
red.

3)  If you're using the other wire,
strip the ends and solder one end to
of each to the red and green on the exfone, and one end to an alligator
clip.

4)  Go to a near by house and locate
the little gray box. It's simple to
find, look by the gas meter. It should
have the Bell logo on it.

5)  To open this thing, put your hand
underneath it and hit upwards. You
should get contact with the bottom
edge of it.

6)  Now it should come open nice and
easy. Look inside and you will see exfive screws in this pattern:

                *     *

          f        *

          f     *     *

7)  The screw in the middle and the
two on the left do nothing. (You may
want to check the two on the left,
some people have a second line hooked
up to these two.) All you need to
worry about are the two on the right.
The one in the  1 right-hand corner is
usually the green, and the one in the
bottom right-hand corner is usually
the red.

8)  Clip an alligator clip to the
corresponding terminals. (Red to red,
the green to green.) You should get a
dial tone. If you don't, switch the
alligator clips around. If you still
don't get a dial tone (or someones
conversation!) then the line has
probably been disconnected or the fone
is off the hook.

Ideas of use for the Bud Box
===== == === === === === ===

Get ALOT of wire and run it into your
house. Then you'll be an extension of
that line. The fone will ring and you
can listen to everything thats going
on on the that line.

You can call direct to any place using
normal Bell service (GASP!). i.e.:
1-702-831-4263. The bill will be not
be charged to you. It will be charged
to your neighbors (or whoever.).

If you want to have two lines to call
(providing the house that the line is
from is always vacant.), you can just
dial: 444-1787 and you should get a
recording stating what number it is.
To test this, dial the number the
recording says, if it's busy, you're
set.

   -=*> HOW TO MAKE A BULB BOMBive:<*=-
            THE FIRST WAY...

      -=*> BY - VORPAL BLADE <*=-


             - MATERIALS -

1) A FEW LIGHT BULBS
2) TORCH (ONE THAT WILL MELT GLASS,
   RADIO SHACK SINGLE CYLINDER MODEL.)
3) GASOLINE
4) LIQUID SOAP
5) EPOXY GLUE

          f   - PROCEDURE -

1) MAKE A HOLE IN THE LIGHT BULB ABOUT
   HALF AN INCH BELOW THE METAL PART.
   (DON'T MAKE IT ON THE BOTTOM,
   BECAUSE IF THE SEAL YOU WILL MAKE
   SHOULD BREAK, THE PERSON/ROOM YOU
   WANT TO ELIMINATE WILL NOTICE THE
   HOLE (THE GASOLINE WILL DRIP ON THE
   FLOOR!).

2) NOW, CAREFULLY FILL THE LIGHT BULB
   ABOUT  HALF  FULL WITH GAS, AND THEN
   THE REST WITH SOAP (HOLD AT AN ANGLE
   IF YOU HAVE TO).  NOW, USE THE EPOXY
   GLUE AND GLUE THE HOLE SHUT.

3) THIRDLY, TAKE THE EPOXY GLUE AND
   GLUE OVER THE HOLE.

4) FINALLY, FIND A LIGHT SOCKET AND
   SCREW THE BULB IN. MAKE SURE THE
   LIGHT IT OFF. IF IT IS ON, THEN, I
   WILL SEND FLOWERS. DON'T TEST IT,
   UNLESS YOU ARE COMMITTING SUICIDE!

   THIS IS AN ANTI-PERSONNEL BOMB MEANT FOR MILLING CROWDS. THE BOTTOM OF A SOFT
DRINK CAN IS HALF CUT OUT AND BENT BACK. A GIANT FIRECRACKER OR OTHER EXPLOSIVE
IS PUT IN AND SURROUNDED WITH NUTS AND BOLTS OR ROCKS. THE FUSE IS THEN ARMED
WITH A CHEMICAL DELAY IN A PLASTIC DRINKING STRAW.

   AFTER FIRST MAKING SURE THERE ARE NO CHILDREN NEARBY, THE ACID OR GLYCERINE
IS PUT INTO THE STRAW AND THE CAN IS SET DOWN BY A TREE OR WALL WHERE IT WILL
NOT BE KNOCKED OVER. THE DELAY SHOULD GIVE YOU THREE TO FIVE MINUTES. IT WILL
THEN HAVE A SHATTERING EFFECT ON PASSERBYS.

   IT IS HARDLY LIKELY THAT ANYONE WOULD PICK UP AND DRINK FROM SOMEONE ELSE'S
SOFT DRINK CAN. BUT IF SUCH A CRUDE PERSON SHOULD TRY TO DRINK FROM YOUR BOMB
HE WOULD BREAK A NASTY HABIT FAST!

YOU WILL NEED:-

A METAL CAN WITH A PRESS ON LID.  EXAMPLES ARE PAINT CANS, OR HERSHEY'S COCO
OR NESTLE'S QUIK CANS.  THE NEW PAPER CANS WILL WORK TOO BUT THEY WEAR OUT
FAST. A TANK OF ACETYLENE OR THE ACETYLENE GENERATOR FROM THE PRECEEDING FILE
IN THIS SERIES <FZFF03>.

THE SETUP/ASSEMBLY:-

     DRILL OR POKE A SMALL HOLE IN THE MIDDLE OF THE BOTTOM OF THE METAL CAN
OF 1/16" OR LESS, DIAMETER.   DRILL OR POKE A SIMILAR HOLE IN THE MIDDLE OF THE
LID OF THE CAN.  PUT A PIECE OF WATERPROOF TAPE (LIKE BLACK ELECTRICIANS TAPE)
OVER THE OUTSIDE OF EACH HOLE.

USING IT:-

     THE EASIEST WAY TO SAFELY LOAD THE "CANON" IS TO BEGIN BY FILLING IT WITH
WATER AND THEN USING IT IN A COLLECTION TROUGH (LIKE THE ONE SHOWN IN FZFF03;
ACETYLENE GAS).   THE BUBBLER TUBE CAN BE CONNECTED TO AN ACETYLENE TANK SUCH
AS ON A WELDERS TORCH, OR THE ACETYLENE GENERATOR OR BAGS OF ACETYLENE FILLED
IN PRINCIPLE:-

     ONCE YOU TAKE THE <NOW LOADED> "CANON" TO WHERE YOU WANT TO USE IT, BY
SETTING THE CAN ON SOMETHING THAT WILL KEEP IT OFF THE GROUND AND IS
VENTILLATED UNDERNEATH, COUNTDOWN CAN BE STARTED.  REMOVE THE TAPE FROM BOTH
HOLES.  SINCE ACETYLENE I_IGHTER THAN AIR, AIR WILL BEGIN ENTERING THE BOTTOM
HOLE AS ACETYLENE FLOATS OUT THE TOP.  THE FLOW IS JUST ABOUT RIGHT TO MAKE A
LANTERN FLAME ABOVE THE EXIT HOLE AT THE TOP.  PROMPTLY LIGHT THE TOP HOLE OF
THE CAN AND AND GET BACK, DELIBERATELY, AS YOU WILL HAVE SEVERAL MINUTES TO
WAIT.  (THE TIME DEPENDS ON THE SIZE OF THE CAN YOU USE AND THE SIZE OF THE
PINHOLES YOU PUT IN IT.)

     AT THC BEGINNING, THE CAN CONTAINS AND VENTS ONLY ACETYLENE SO THAT ONLY
ABOVE THE CAN CAN IT GET ENOUGH AIR TO BURN, AND ONLY THE GAS WHICH HAS EXITE 
IS FLAMABLE.  AS AIR COMES IN THE BOTTOM, THOUGH, IT BEGINS TO MIX WITH THE
GAS INSIDE THE CAN SO THAT THE MIXTURE BECOMES INCREASINGLY ACTIVATED WITH
OXYGEN. EVENTUALLY THE AIR LEVEL WILL REACH ITS FLASH RATIO, AND THE FLAME FROM
THE TOP OF THE CAN WILL MOVE DOWN INSIDE, IGNITING ALL THE ACETYLENE THAT
REMAINS INSIDE THE CAN AT ONCE, AND THE "CANON" GOES OFF.

FIRING PHILOSOPHIES:-

     STRAIGHT OFF YOU WILL SEE THAT YOU HAVE A CHOICE OF SETTING OFF THE SHOT
WITH THE LID UP (TO SHOOT THE LID) OR THE LID DOWN (TO SHOOT THE CAN) INTO THE
AIR.  ALSO, BECAUSE THE FUSE FLAME IS SENSITIVE TO WIND, YOU MAY WANT TO
FASHION A CHIMNEY (OR "BARREL") OUT OF ANOTHER CAN, A ROLL OF LINOLEUM OR
FORMICA, OR A LENGTH OF PVC PIPE OF SUITABLE DIAMETER.  THIS HAS TWO ADDITIONAL
ADVANTAGES BEYOND KEEPING THE FLAME LIGHTED, IN THAT IT DRAMATICALLY ENHANCES
THE BOOM, BUT ALSO IMPROVES YOUR CONTROL OVER THE DIRECTION OF THE PROJECTILE
EJECTED.

     BY LOADING MANY CANISTERS WITH THEIR HOLES TAPED, BEFORE HAND, YOU THEN
HAVE YOURSELF AN EASY RELOADER, CARTRIDGE FASHION.

     ANOTHER VARIATION IS TO PUT THE PINHOLES ON OPPOSITE SIDES OF THE METAL
CAN AND THEN MOUNTING IT IN THE "BARREL" HORIZONTALLY.  IN THIS CASE, A
BACKSTOP IS NEEDED AND THE CHIMNEY CANNOT BE PART OF THE "BARREL".

     SOME OF MY BEST SHOTS HAVE BEEN 5 GAL ICE CREAM CARTON OR HAT BOX ONE-
SHOTTERS, FILLED DRY FROM AN ACETYLENE TANK AT A WIDE SETTING.  BECAUSE OF THE
UNCERTAINTY OF THIS FILL METHOD, THESE CANONS WERE LIT WITH SPARKLERS ON THE
END OF A 12 FOOT POLE.

     THIS KIND OF CANON READILY LENDS ITSELF TO LOUDNESS, ALTITUDE AND
DISTANCE COMPETITIONS, SINCE IT'S ALL HAND MADE.

         THE FOLLOWING IS THE LOGIN PROCEDURE TO LOGIN TO A C.B.I. SYSTEM,
  A FEW C.B.I. LOGIN PORT NUMBERS, INFORMATION ON THE SYSTEM, AND OBTAIN C.B.I.
  ACCOUNTS.


 *** HOW TO GET CBI INFORMATION ***

         OK, YOU CAN GET CBI ACCOUNTS AND CBI PRINTOUTS AT YOUR LOCAL MALL.
 THE BEST PLACES TO CHECK ARE:  INSURANCE PLACES, LAWYERS, DOCTORS, AND CAR
 DEALERSHIPS, AND CHECK SOME PLACES IN THE MALL THAT MIGHT HAVE TO CHECK A
 PERSON'S CREDIT.  TRASH IN THEIR DUMPSTER LOOKING FOR PRINTOUTS.  MOST PLACES
 BUFFER CAPTURE THEIR WHOLE CALL TO CBI INCLUDING THE NUMBER, EVERYTHING ON
 BUFFER, IT'S BETTER THAN CHRISTMAS.  OK, SO LOOK OBTAIN THESE CBI PRINTOUTS
 AND CRUISE HOME TO THE OLD COMPUTER.

 *** WHAT YOU NEED ***

         THE NEXT STEP SHOULD BE, OBTAIN A DRIVERS LICENSE OR SOME OTHER FORM
 OF ID THAT CONTAINS A PERSON'S NAME, ADDRESS, AND SOCIAL SECURITY NUMBER.  IF
 YOU DO NOT HAVE THIS, YOU CAN'T GET SHIT, YOU DEFINITELY NEED THEIR SOCIAL
 SECURITY NUMBER FOR THIS.  THE BEST THING TO DO IS GO CASING (* CHECK OTHER
 X ORGANIZATION FILES ON CASING *) AND STEAL A WALLET CONTAINING A DRIVERS
 LICENSE.

 *** STEPS TO ACCESSING CBI ***

         SECONDLY, YOU SHOULD EXAMINE THE WHOLE PRINTOUT, AND MAKE SURE YOU
 CAN READ EVERYTHING ON THE PRINTOUT, YOU DON'T WANT TO FUCK IT UP, BE AS
 EFFICIENT AS POSSIBLE, EVEN THOUGH CBI DOES ALLOW YOU TO MAKE SOME MISTAKES
 BEFORE IT DISCONNECTS.

 *** LOGIN TO CBI ***

         NOW, YOU SHOULD HAVE EVERYTHING SET OUT NEXT TO YOU FOR QUICK ONLINE
 REFERENCE.  DIAL THE NUMBER AT 300 BPS, E, 7, 1.  CHECK ON THE PRINTOUT IF THE
 CBI PORT HAS MORE THAN 300 BAUD, IT JUST MIGHT.  IF YOU CANNOT FIND A LOCAL
 PORT FOR CBI TRY 1-800-624-1395.  NOTE: EVERYTHING IN < > IS ME MAKING A NOTE.

  accounts.

 *** HOW TO GET CBI INFORMATION ***



         Ok, you can get CBI accounts and CBI printouts at your local mall.
 The best places to check are:  Insurance Places, Lawyers, Doctors, and Car
 Dealerships, and check some places in the mall that might have to check a
 person's credit.  Trash in their dumpsteng forouts.  places
 buffecaptheir whole call to CBI including the number, everything on
 buffer, it's better than christmas.  Ok, so look obtain these CBI printouts
 and cruise home to the old computer.

 *** WHAT YOU NEED ***

         The next step should be, obtain a drivers license or some other form
 of ID that contains a person's name, address, and social security number.  If
 you do not have this, you can't get shit, you definitely need their social
 security number for this.  The best thing to do is go casing (* check other
 X Organization files on casing *) and steal a wallet containing a drivers
 license.

 *** STEPS TO ACCESSING CBI ***

         Secondly, you should examine the whole printout, and make sure you
 can read everything on the printout, you don't want to fuck it up, be as
 efficient as possible, even though CBI does allow you to make some mistakes
 before it disconnects.

 *** LOGIN TO CBI ***

         Now, you should have everything set out next to you for quick online
 reference.  Dial the number at 300 BPS, E, 7, 1.  Check on the printout if the
 CBI port has more than 300 Baud, it just might.  If you cannot find a local
 port for CBI try 1-800-624-1395.  Note: everything inive:< > is me making a note.

-           Cheese Box Info            -
----------------------------------------

       A Cheesebox(named for the type of
box the first one was found in)is a
type of box which will, in effect, make
your telephone a Pay Phone.....This is a
simple,modernized, and easy way of
doing it....

      Inside Info:These were first used
by bookies many years ago as a way of
making calls to people without being
called Dy the cops or having their
numbers traced and/or tapped......

     How To Make A Modern Cheese Box

     Ingredients:

     1 Call Forwarding service on the
       line

     1 Set of Red Box Tones

     The number to your prefix's
Intercept operator(do some scanning
for this one)

     How To:

       After you find the number to the
intercept operator in your prefix,
use your ome scanning
for this one)

     How To:

       After you find the number to the
intercept operator in your prefix,
use your call forwarding and forward all
calls to her...this will make your
phone stay off the hook(actually, now it
waits foD a quarter to be dropped
in)...you now have a cheese box...In
Order To Call Out On This Line:You
must use your Red Box tones and generate
the quarter dropping
in...then,you can make phone calls to
people...as far as I know, this is
fairly safe, and theD do not check
he quarter dropping
in...then,you can make phone calls to
people...as far as I know, this is
fairly safe, and theD do not check
much...Although I
am not sure, I think you can even make
credit card calls from a cheesebox
phone and not get traced.

                            Clear Box Plans


   The clear box is a new device which has just been invented that can be used
throughout Canada and rural United States. The clear box works on "Post-Pay"
payphones (fortress fones). Those are the payphones that dont require payment
until after the connection is established. You pick up the fone, get
a dial tone, dial your number, and then insert your money after the person
answers.If you dont deposit the money then you can not speak to the person on
the other end- because your mouth piece is cut off, but, not the ear piece.
(obviously these phones are nice for free calls to weather or time or
other such recordings).All you must do is to go to your nearby Radio Shack, or
electronics store,and get a four-transistor amplifier and a
telephone suction cup induction pick-up. The induction pick-up would be
hooked up as it normally would to record a conversation, except that it
would be plugged into the out-
put of the amplifier and a microphone would be hooked to the input. So when
the party that is being called answers, the caller could speak through the
little microphone instead. His voice then goes through the amplifier and out
the induction coil, and into the back of the reciever where it would then be
broadcast through the phone lines and the other party would be able to hear
the caller. The Clear Box thus 'clears up' the problem of not being heard.
Luckily, the line will not be cut-off after a certain amount of time because
it will wait forever for the coins to be put in.The biggest advantage for all
of us about this new clear box is the exfact that this type of payphone will most likely become very common.
Due to a few things: 1st, it is a cheap way of getting the DTF,dial-tone-first
service, 2nd, it doesnt require any special equipment, (for the phone
company)This payphone will work on any phone line. Ususally a payphone line is
different, but this is a regular phone line and it is set up so the phone
does all the charging, not the company.

->HOW TO RIP OFF A CHANGE MACHINE<-
-----------------------------------

  SO YA NEED MONEY, AND YA NEED IT
FAST!?  WELL HERE IS A FAST AND EASY
WAY TO CHANGE YOUR NICKELS AND DIMES
INTO QUARTERS!

HERE'S THE EQUIPMENT THAT YOU NEED
ACCESS TO IN A FAIRLY SECLUDED AREA:

1) A COPY MACHINE THAT IS OF FAIRLY
   GOOD QUALITY.. (THE ONES AT MY
   COLLEGE ARE SHITTY, BUT THEY WORK
   ANYWAY...)

2) A CHANGE MACHINE THAT CHANGES 1'S
   AND 5'S TO QUARTERS.

3) A 1 OR 5 DOLLAR BILL

4) A TABLE PAPER CUTTER THAT CUTS PAPER
   EXACTLY STRAIGHT.

5) A LOT OF COURAGE!


OK WHAT YOU DO IS WALK INTO THE PLACE
AND COPY THE FACE SIDE OF YOUR DOLLAR.
PUT THE DOLLAR BILL FACE DOWN AND IN
THE EXACT MIDDLE OF THE MACHINE'S
WINDOW.  THE FIRST TIME YOU DO THIS,
ONLY MAKE ONE COPY, BECAUSE IT MIGHT
NOT WORK CORRECTLY.  WHEN YOU GET YOUR
COPIED DOLLAR BILL FROM THE MACHINE,
CHECK THE TONER AND MAKE SURE THAT IT
IS JUST LIKE THE ORIGINAL.  IF ITS TOO
DARK OR TOO LIGHT, THEN ADJUST THE COPY
MACHINE ACCORDINGLY.  WHEN YOU GET A
PERFECTLY CONTRASTED DOLLAR, TAKE IT
OVER TO THE PAPER CUTTER AND PUT THE
ORIGINAL DOLLAR OVER THE PAPER DOLLAR
AND SLICE THE DOLLAR OUT OF THE BIG
PIECE OF PAPER.  NOW FOR THE PHUN PART.

MAKE SURE THAT THCRE ARE NO HIDDEN
CAMERAS IN THE ROOM WATCHING YOU, OR
YOU'LL BE CAUGHT FOR SURE!!!!!!!!!!

WALK UP TO THE CHANGE MACHINE AND
CASUALLY SLIDE THE DOLLAR BILL INTO
THE MACHINE AND PUSH THE CARRIAGE
OR WHATEVER IN.  IF THE DOLLAR COMES
BACK OUT THEN TAKE IT, RIP IT IN HALF
AND PUT IT IN YOUR POCKET.  THROW IT
AWAY SOMEPLACE ELSE.  BUT IF THE
JINGLING JOY OF QUARTERS COMES, YOU
WILL BE IN THE MONEY!!!!  BUT WHEN YOU
DO IT, DO IT IN MASS AMMOUNTS, BECAUSE
IF YOU DO ONE A DAY, THEY'LL PROBABLY
POST A GUARD IN THERE OR SOMETHING...

THIS METHOD GOT ME $10 IN ONE SESSION,
BUT I'M SURE THE NEXT TIME I GO BACK
THERE I'LL MAKE A LOT MORE....HEH HEH

HAVE PHUN NOW, AND TELL ME YOUR RECORD
WINNINGS IN ONE DAY... BETTER THAN THE
LOTTERY!

 HOW TO START YOUR OWN CONFERENCES!

BLACK BART SHOWED HOW TO START A CONFERENCE CALL THRU AN 800 EXCHANGE, AND I
WILL NOW EXPLAIN HOW TO START A CONFERENCE CALL IN A MORE ORTHODOX FASHIO, THE
2600 HZ. TONE.

FIRSTLY, THE FONE COMPANY HAS WHAT IS CALLED SWITCHING SYSTEMS.  THERE ARE SE
VERAL TYPES, BUT THC ONE WE WILL CONCERN OURSELVES WITH, IS ESS (ELECTRONIC
SWITCHING SYSTEM).  IF YOUR AREA IS ZONED FOR ESS, DO NOT START A CONFERENCE
CALL VIA THE 2600 HZ. TONE, OR BELL SECURITY WILL NAIL YOUR ASS!  TO FND OUT IF
YOU ARE UNDER ESS, CALL YOUR LOCAL BUSINESS OFFICE, AND ASK THEM IF YOU CAN GET
CALL WAITING/FORWARDING, AND IF YOU CAN, THAT MEANS THAT YOU ARE IN ESS COUNTRY
, AND CONFERENCE CALLING IS VERY, VERY DANGEROUS!!! NOW, IF YOU ARE NOT IN ESS,
YOU WILL NEED THE FOLLOWING EQUIPMENT:

  AN APPLE CAT II MODEM
  A COPY OF TSPS 2 OR CAT'S MEOW
  A TOUCH TONE FONE LINE
  AND A TOUCH TONE FONE. (TRUE TONE)

NOW, WITH TSPS 2, DO THE FOLLOWING:

 RUN TSPS 2
 CHOSE OPTION 1
 CHOSE OPTION 6
 CHOSE SUB-OPTION 9

  NOW TYPE:

 1-514-555-1212 (DASHES ARE NOT NEEDED)

LISTEN WITH YOUR HANDSET, AND AS SOON AS YOU HEAR A LOUD 'CLICK', THEN TYPE

 $

TO GENERATE THE 2600 HZ. TONE.  THIS OBNOXIOUS TONE WILL CONTINUE FOR A FEW
SECONDS, THEN LISTEN AGAIN AND YOU SHOULD HEAR ANOTHER LOUD 'CLICK'.

 NOW TYPE:

 KM2130801050S

WHERE 'K' = KP TONE
      'M' = MULTI FREQUENCY MODE
      'S' = S TONE

NOW LISTEN TO THE HANDSET AGAIN, AND WAIT UNTIL YOU HEAR THE 'CLICK' AGAIN.
THEN TYPE:

  KM2139752975S

WHERE 2139751975 IS THE NUMBER TO BILL THE CONFERENCE CALL TO. NOTE: 213-975-
1975 IS A DISCONNECTED NUMBER, AND I STRONGLY ADVISE THAT YOU ONLY BILL THE
CALL TO THIS NUMBER, OR THE FONE COMPANY WILL FIND OUT, AND THEN..........
REMEBER, CONFERENCE CALLS ARE ITEMIZED, SO IF YOU DO BILL IT TO AN ENEMY'S NUMB
ER, HE CAN EASILY FIND OUT WHO DID IT AND HE CAN BUST YOU!

YOU SHOULD NOW HEAR 3 BEEPS, AND A SHORT PRE-RECORDED MESSAGE.  FROM HERE ON,
EVERYTHING IS ALL MENU DRIVEN.

 CONFERENCE CALL COMMANDS
 ---------- ---- --------

   FROM THE '#' MODE:

     1 = CALL A NUMBER
     6 = TRANSFER CONTROL
     7 = HANGS UP THE CONFERENCE CALL
     9 = WILL CALL A CONFERENCE OPERATR

STAY AWAY FROM 7 AND 9!  IF FOR SOME REASON AN OPERATOR GETS ON-LINE,
HANG UP! IF YOU GET A BUSY SIGNAL AFTER KM2130801050S, THAT MEANS THAT THE
TELECONFEREN CING LINE IS TEMPORARILY DOWN.  TRY LATER, PREFERRABLY FROM 9AM TO
5PM WEEK DAYS, SINCE CONFERENCE CALLS ARE PRIMARILY DESIGNED FOR BUSINESS
PEOPLE.
                THE LEECH

   HOWDY.  WELL, THIS IS MY FIRST CDC FILE I'VE WRITTEN IN AWHILE SINCE I'VE
BEEN AWAY AND TOYING AROUND WITH ALOT OF NEW IDEAS AND STUFF OF THAT MATTER.
BY THE WAY, THIS SHOULD ONLY BE DONE BY REAL AND EXPERIENCED HACKERS LIKE
MYSELF AND TEQUILA WILLY!  DON'T TRY THIS AT HOME!!  ANYWAY, ON WITH THE FILE.

THE STORY BEHIND IT ALL
=======================

   WELL, TODAY I WAS OUT WITH MY GIRLFRIEND AT THC LIBRARY, YES, I WANTED TO
PICK UP A COPY OF HYDE'S 'THE PHONE BOOK' (A BOOK ABOUT TELEPHONE FRAUD AND
BOXING AND OTHER NEATO THINGS).  WELL, TO CONTINUE WITH MY ACTION PACKED
EXCITEMENT, I NOTICED THAT THC LIBRARY STILL HAS THE OLD CARD CATALOG, BUT IT
NOW HAS COMPUTER-OPERATED CATALOGS.  IT'S RUN ON A DIGITAL-VT1200 COMPUTER
(I THINK THAT'S WHAT IT'S CALLED), THE SYSTEM SORT OF RESEMBLED UNIX IN A WAY.
ANmiliWAY, I WAS FIDDLING WITH THE COMPUTER AND PLAYED WITH IT FOR AT LEAST 15
MINUTES.  THIS BITCHY LADY CAME OVER AND TOLD ME TO 'STOP MESSING WITH THE
DAMN COMPUTERS!!' I REPLIED 'FUCK YOU, I'M LOOKING FOR A BOOK!'   SHE WALKED
AWAY IN DISGUST.  A SINISTER SMILE CAME UPON MY LIPS AND MY FINGERS BLAZED
AWAY AT THE KEYS.  I TRIED EVERYTHING FOR 10 MINUTES LIKE SYSTEM, COM, BOX,
CARD, AND EVEN HACKER (I WAS DESPERATE!).  SO I JUST TYPED IN MUMBO-JUMBO
FOR LIKE 10 MINUTES AND THEN I JUST TYPED IN DOS.  THE SCREEN FLICKERED, IT
READ:

                         CAMDEN COUGTY LIBRARY SYSTEM

          f                 1.  MENION DATABASE
                            2.  INFOTRON DATABASE

  PLEASE SELECT A NEW DATABASE.  YOU ARE CURRENTLY CONNECTED TO MENION.

>> 2 (IS WHAT I TYPED)
INFOTRON DATABASE IS UNAVAILABLE.  SORRY.

  IT THEN RETURNED TO THE MAIN MENU WHERE I SHOULD SELECT A BOOK.  I TYPED
DOS AGAIN, WENT BACK, BUT THIS TIME I TYPED:

>> 2,99E99 (1 MORE THAN THE LARGEST NUMBER A SMALL-COMPUTER CAN HANDLE)

IT PRINTED:

FATAL ERROR! SYSTEM ERROR!
ERROR IN LINE 10200, OFF.

  THEN THE WHOLE SYSTEM FROZE UP.  THE BITCHYnougheDY WALKED OVER AGAIN AND Y CANLED
AT ME AGAIN.  I PLAYED DUMB, 'DUH, I DON'T KNOW WHAT I DID!'  SHE DEMANDED THAT
I MOVE TO ANOTHER TERMINAL (BY THE WAY, THE LIBRARY IS EQUIPPED WITH 9
TERMINALS AT 3 TABLES PER FLOOR, THAT'S 27 ACCESSABLE TERMINALS PER FLOOR!
YES, I CAN MULTIPLY!!) SO I OBLIDGED AND MOVED TO ANOTHER TERMINAL.  I WATCHED
HER FIDDLE AND FUCK WITH THE FUCKED-UP TERMINAL FOR 10-15 MINUTES.  SHE DID
EVERYTHING.  TURNED IT ON/OFF, SLAPPED IT, BANGED IT, EVERYTHING.  THEN SHE
PUT AN 'OUT OF ORDER' SIGN ON IT.  SO I FUCKED UP THE COMPUTER I WAS ON, THEN
DID 3 OTHERS, THEN MOVED TO THE NEXT FLOOR.

HOW TO DO IT: A RUN DOWN
========================
AT >> ON THE SELECT BOOen,/AUTHOR/CARD # MENU TYPE 'DOS'
AT >> ON THE DATABASE ENTRY MENU TYPE '2,99E99'
THEN SIT BACK AND WATCH THE FUN.

TERMINALS
=========

  THESE TERMINALS WERE JUST MONITORS AND KEYBOARDS, NO PROCESSOR, NOTHING.  IT
WAS OBVIO.SLY CONNECTED TO AnougheRGER MAINFRAME WITHIN THE BUILDING.  I SUSPECT
IF YOU MESS WITH THE TERMINALS MORE YOU MIGHT BE ABLE TO EXIT TO DOS, CRASH
IT PERMANENTLY, DIAL OUT VIA THERE MODEM SOMEWHERE, OR SEND NEAT0 MESSAGES TO
OTHER TERMINALS WITHIN THE BUILDING.  HAVE FUN WITH THIS.

   OF ALL THE NEW 1960S WONDERS OF TELEPHONE TECHNOLOGY -
SATELLITES, ULTRA MODERN TRAFFIC SERVICE POSITIONS (TSPS) FOR
OPERATORS, THE PICTUREPHONE, AND SO ON - THE ONE THAT GAVE BELL
LABS THE MOST TROUBLE, AND UNEXPECTEDLY BECAME THE GREATEST
DEVELOPMENT EFFORT IN BELL SYSTEM'S HISTORY, WAS THE PERFECTION
OF AN ELECTRONIC SWITCHING SYSTEM, OR ESS.

   IT MAY BE RECALLED THAT SUCH A SYSTEM WAS THE SPECIFIC END IN
VIEW WHEN THE PROJECT THAT HAD CULMINATED IN THE INVENTION OF THE
TRANSISTOR HAD BEEN LAUNCHED BACK IN THE 1930S. AFTER SUCCESSFUL
ACCOMPLISHMENT OF THAT PLANNED MIRACLE IN 1947-48, FURTHER DELAYS
WERE BROUGHT ABOUT BY FINANCIAL STRINGENCY AND THE NEED FOR
FURTHER DEVELOPMENT OF THE TRANSISTOR ITSELF. IN THE EARLY 1950S,
A LABS TEAM BEGAN SERIOUS WORK ON ELECTRONIC SWITCHING. AS EARLY
AS 1955, WESTERN ELECTRIC BECAME INVOLVED WHEN FIVE ENGINEERS
FROM THE HAWTHORNE WORKS WERE ASSIGNED TO COLLABORATE WITH THE
LABS ON THE PROJECT. THE PRESIDENT OF AT&T IN 1956, WROTE
CONFIDENTLY, "AT BELLnougheBS, DEVELOPMENT OF THE NEW ELECTRONIC
SWITCHING SYSTEM IS GOING FULL SPEED AHEAD. WE ARE SURE THIS WILL
LEAD TO MANY IMPROVEMENTS IN SERVICE AND ALSO TO GREATER
EFFICIENCY. THE FIRST SERVICE TRIAL WILL START IN MORRIS, ILL.,
IN 1959." SHORTLY THEREAFTER, KAPPEL SAID THAT THE COST OF THE
WHOLE PROJECT WOULD PROBABLY BE $45 MILLION.

   BUT IT GRADUALLY BECAME APPARENT THAT THE DEVELOPEMENT OF A
COMMERCIALLY USABLE ELECTRONIC SWITCHING SYSTEM - IN EFFECT, A
COMPUTERIZED TELEPHONE EXCHANGE - PRESENTED VASTLY GREATER
TECHNICAL PROBLEMS THAN HAD BEEN ANTICIPATED, AND THAT,
ACCORDINGLY, BELLnLABS HAD VASTLY UNDERESTIMATED BOTH THE TIME
AND THE INVESTMENT NEEDED TO DO THE JOB. THE YEAR 1959 PASSED
WITHOUT THC PROMISED FIRST TRIAL AT MORRIS, ILLINOIS; IT WAS
FINALLY MADE IN NOVEMBER 1960, AND QUICKLY SHOWED HOW MUCH MORE
WORK REMAINED TO BE DONE. E DIRIME DRAGGED ON AND COSTS MOUNTED,
THERE WAS A CONCERN AT AT&T AND SOMETHING APPROACHING PANIC AT
BELLnLABS. BUT THC PROJECT HAD TO GO FORWARD; BY THIS TIME THE
INVESTMENT WAS TOO GREAT TO BE SACRIFICED, AND IN ANY CASE,
FORWARD PROJECTIONS OF INCREASED DEMAND FOR TELEPHONE SERVICE
INDICATED THAT WITHIN A PHEW YEARS A TIME WOULD COME WHEN,
WITHOUT THE QUANTUM LEAP IN SPEED AND FLEXIBILITY THAT ELECTRONIC
SWITCHING WOULD PROVIDE, THE NATIONAL NETWORK WOULD BE UNABLE TO
MEET THE DEMAND. IN NOVEMBER 1963, AN ALL-ELECTRONIC SWITCHING
SYSTEM WENT INTO USE AT THE BROWN ENGINEERING COMPANY AT COCOA
BEACH, FLORIDA. BUT THIS WAS A SMALL INSTALLATION, ESSENTIALLY
ANOTHER TEST INSTALLATION, SERVING ONLY A SINGLE COMPANY.
KAPPEL'S TONE ON THE SUBJECT IN THE 1964 ANNUAL REPORT WAS, FOR
HIM, AN ALMOST APOLOGETIC: "ELECTRONIC SWITCHING EQUIPMENT MUST
BE MANUFACTURED IN VOLUME TO UNPRECEDENTED STANDARDS OF
RELIABILITY.... TO TURN OUT THE EQUIPMENT ECONOMICALLY AND WITH
GOOD SPEED, MASS PRODUCTION METHODS MUST BE DEVELOPED; BUT, AT
THE SAME TIME, THERE CAN BE NO LOSS OF PRECISION..." ANOTHER YEAR


.


IILLIONS OF DOLLARS LATER, ON MAY 30, 1965, THE FIRST
COMMERCIAL ELECTRIC CENTERAL OFFICE WAS PUT INTO SERVICE AT
SUCCASUNNA, NEW JERSEY.

   EVEN AT SUCCASUNNA, ONLY 200 OF THE TOWN'S 4,300 SUBSCRIBERS
INITIALLY HAD THE BENEFIT OF ELECTRONIC SWITCHING'S ADDED SPEED
AND ADDITIONAL SERVICES, SUCH AS PROVISION FOR THREE PARTY
CONVERSATIONS AND AUTOMATIC TRANSFER OF INCOMING CALLS. BUT AFTER
THAT, ESS WAS ON ITS WAY. IN JANUARY 1966, THE SECOND COMMERCIAL
INSTALLATION, THIS ONE SERVING 2,900 TELEPHONES, WENT INTO
SERVICE IN CHASE, MARYLAND. BY THE END OF 1967 THERE WERE
ADDITIONAL ESS OFFICES IN CALIFORNIA, CONNECTICUT, MINNESOTA,
GEORGIA, NEW YORK, FLORIDA, AND PENNSYLVANIA; BY THE END OF 1970
THERE WERE 120 OFFICES SERVING 1.8 MILLION CUSTOMERS; AND BY 1974
THERE WERE 475 OFFICES SERVING 5.6 MILLION CUSTOMERS.

   THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN CONVENTIONAL SWITCHING AND ELECTRONIC
SWITCHING IS THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN "HARDWARE" AND "SOFTWARE"; IN
THE FORMER CASE, MAINTENENCE IS DONE ON THE SPOT, WITH
SCREWDRIVER AND PLIERS, WHILE IN THE CASE OF ELECTRONIC
SWITCHING, IT CAN BE DONE REMOTELY, BY COMPUTER, FROM A CENTERAL
POINT, MAKING IT POSSIBLE TO HAVE ONLY ONE OR TWO TECHNICIANS ON
DUTY AT A TIME AT EACH SWITCHING CENTER. THE DEVELOPMENT PROGRAM,
WHEN THE FINAL FIGURES WERE ADDED UP, WAS FOUND TO HAVE REQUIRED
A STAGGERING FOUR THOUSAND MAN-YEARS OF WORK AT BELL LABS AND TO
HAVE COST NOT $45 MILLION BUT $500 MILLION!

                THE END

Summary of FBI Computer Systems

By Ralph Harvey

    This article is reprinted from Full BOUT Blosure. Copyright (c) 1986
Capitol Information Association.  All rights reserved. Permission is hereby
granted to reprint this article providing this message is included in its
entirety.  Full Disclosure, Box 8275, Ann Arbor, Michigan 48107. $15/yr.

 The FBI maintains several computer systems.  The most common of which is
call NCIC (National Crime Information Computer). NCIC maintains a database of
information about such things as stolen carsE, 1 len boats, missing persons,
wanted persons, arrest records. It provides quick access to these records by
State, Local and Federal law enforcement agencies.  NCIC is directly linked
with the Treasury Department's TECS computer and many State computer systems.
According to William H. Webster, Director of the FBI:

When a police officer stops a car and is uncertain about who he's going to
meet when he gets out, he can plug into this system [NCIC] and in a matter of
a few seconds he can find out whether that person is a fugitive or the
automobile is stolen. Incidentally, we receive almost 400,000 inquires of
this nature each day in the NCIC system.

 When an agency determines that a subject is a fugitive, it supplies the FBI
computer with as much of the following information as possible: 1) Name and
case number; 2) Alias; 3) Race; 4) Sex; 5) Height; 6) Weight; 7) Color of
hair; 8) Color of eyes; 9) Description of any identifying scars, marks and
tattoos; 10) Date of birth; 11) Place of birth; 12) Social Security Number;
13) Passport Number; 14) Last known address; 15) Nationality; 16) If a
naturalized U.S. Citizen, date, place, and certificate number; 17)
Occupation; 18) The criminal violation with which subject is charged; 19)
Date of warrant; 21) Type of warrant -- Bench, Magistrate, etc.; 22) Agency
holding warrant; 23) Any information as to whether the subject is considered
dangerous, is known to own or currently possess firearms, has suicidal
tendencies, or has previously escaped custody; 24) Driver's license number,
year of expiration and State issued; 25) License number of vehicle, aircraft
or vessel subject owns or is known to use, include the year and State; 26)
Description of vehicle, aircraft or vessel subject owns or is known to use;
27) Associates of the subject*1; 28) FBI number; 29) Name and telephone of
the person to contact when subject is apprehended.

 One of the major problems with the system is that the agency that submits an
entry is responsible for keeping it up to date. Once an entry has been made,
there is little motivation for the originating agency to "waste" its time
keeping it up to date, so many entries become incorrect with the passage of
time.

 Another FBI computer system is their Investigative Support Information
System (ISIS). This system is only used to provide support for major
investigations that require the handling of a large volume of complex
information.  It is limited to handling a maximum of 20 cases at a time.

 The ISIS system was used during the investigation of the murder of Federal
Judge John Wood in San Antonio, Texas. In this case, the FBI entered 300,000
pieces of information, including 6,000 interviews, hotel registration
information from every hotel in the area, etc.  The accused, while on trial,
claimed he was several hundred miles away.  The FBI cross referenced his name
& known alias with the hotel registration database and got a match. Contact
with the hotel employees resulted in a positive identification and conviction
of the subject.

 The FBI has a system called the Organized Crime Information Systems (OCIS)
of which director William Webster is "particularly proud."  The system was
started in 1980 in Detroit, Michigan and is one of their most sophisticated
computers. The system is now functions in over 40 locations.

 The OCIS system allows agents in different field offices to share and
analyze information collected in each other's areas.  This system was used to
identify some of the United States citizens who were released from Cuban
prisons in 1984 that had criminal histories in the United States. An OCIS
link was recently opened in Rome, where it's used to support drug

 THIS IS TO INFORM THE AMATUER PHREAKER HOW TO FIND LOCAL DIALUPS OF YOUR AREA.
FIRST TAKE OUT YOUR PACIFIC BELLnY CANLOW PAGES AND LOOK UNDER TELEPHONE
COMMUNICATIONS.  FIND SOME SMALL DINKY LONG DISTANCE COMPANIES THAT YOU HAVEN'T
HEARD OF AND RING IT UP.  HERE'S AN EXAMPLE..

>RING<..<RING>..>CLICK<

OP: BIZ-TEL

YOU: UH..  YES..  MY NAME IS MARC WOOD.. WHAT IS THE NUMBER I CALL TO USE MY
     TRAVEL CARD. (YOU MAY WANT TO SAY YOU MISPLACED THE NUMBER TO CALL)

OP: HOLD PLEASE.. <RINGING CUSTOMER SERVICE>
    <NOW A NEW OPERATOR>

OP: HELLO?

YOU: UH..  YES..  THIS IS MARY WOOD FROM CTI CYROGENTICS..WHAT IS THE NUMBER I
     USE TO USE MY TRAVEL CARD?

OP: OH.. LET ME SEE HERE..  YES..  IT IS 950-1820..

YOU: UH..  AHMM..  AHMM..  1820?

OP: YES SIR.

YOU: OK..  THANK YOU VERY MUCH!

OP: NO PROBLEM.

<CLICK>

iIT MAY NOT BE AS EASY AT THAT UNLESS YOU CAN SOUND LIKE AN INNOCENT CUSTOMER
OF SOME SHIT MADE UP COMPANY THAT'S HAVING PROBLEMS.  AND IT MAY NOT BE AS
SIMPLE AS THAT WHERE IT MATTERS IF THE OPERATOR IS SOME NEW EMPLOYEE THAT'S
JUST TRYING TO MAKE A FEW BUCKS AND IF THAT IS RIGHT..  THEY WILL PROBABLY GIVCONSTYOU IT NOT KNOWING THE COMPANY WILL SOON BE INVADED BY HACKERS AND SOON GO OUT
OF BUSINESS AND LOSE HIS/HERS JOB.  BUT THAT'S ANOTHER STORY.  AFTER YOU GET
THE GUTS TO HACK YOUR NEW 950 AND GET AN ACCOUNT..  YOU MAY WANT TO CALL BACK
AND TRY TO GET THERE 800 DIALUP AND POST AROUND YOUR NEWFOUND CODEZ OR BE
GREEDY AND KEEP IT TO YOURSELF SO IT WILL LAST YOU A MONTH OR SO. BUT OF COURSE
THERE IS ANOTHER METHOD WHICH COULD TAKE SOME TIME?  FIND A 950 BY HAND..  GOOD
LUCK!

    BASIC FIREWORKS BY FORD PREFECT

BECAUSE IT IS SOON GOING BE THE 4TH
I THOUGHT I WOULD SHOW YOU HOW TO MAKE
YOUR OWN FIREWORKS. ALL ARE EXPLOSIVE
BUT IN NORMAL QUANTITIES, AND IF THE
DIRECTIONS ARE FOLLOWED CAREFULLY,
THERE IS LITTLE DANGER OF BLOWING
YOURSELF UP.

CHEMICALS & SAFETY:

POTASSIUM NITRATE IS SOLD COMMERCIALLY
AS SALTPETER AND CAN BE FOUND IN ANY
DRUGSTORE. (IT IS USED AS A DIURETIC
FOR ANIMALS) POWDERED SULFUR IS ALSO
SOLD IN A DRUG STORE AND IS USED TO
REPEL TICKS.
CHARCOAL IS NOTHING MORE THAN YOUR
CHARCOAL BRICKETS POWDERED. SObdUM
CHLORIDE, OH COME ON!, TABLE SALT.
SODIUM CARBONATE IS ALSO CALLED SODA,
SODA ASH, SAL SODA, WASHING SODA, OR
GLASSMAKER'S SODA AND IS USED AS A
WATER SOFTENER.
THAT'S ALL I CAN SAY FOR NOW BUT UNTIL
LATER MORE TO COME!!!!

BUILDING A FLAME THROWER FROM THE BOOK:
THE POOR MAN'S JAMES BOND BY KURT SAXON

AN EXCELLENT LITTLE FLAME THROWER
CAN BE MADE, USING JUST ABOUT ANY METAL
OR PLASTIC HAND SQUIRTER. THE ONLY
CONSIDERATION IS (lAT THE LIQUID MUST
COME OUT IN A STREAM INSTEAD OF AN
ATOMIZED SPRAY.

SOME OIL CANS SHOOT A STREAM 30
FEETS. SPRAYERS CAN OFTEN BE ADJUSTED
FROM A SPRAY TO A STREAM. SPRAYERS OF
VARIOUS KINDS CAN BE FOUND IN AUTO
SUPPLY, GARDEN AND GROCERY STORES.

A SIX-INCH TUBE, USUALLY ALUMINUM
OR BRASS, IS FITTEN ON THE NOZZLE. A
WICK OR PIECE OF HEAVY CLOTH IS WIRED
ONTO THE OTHER END OF THE TUBE. THE
FUEL IS GASOLINE, ACETONE OR LIGHTER
FLUID.

TO USE, THE TUBE IS TILTED DOWNWARD
SLIGHTLY. THE SPRAYER IS SQUEEZED
SLOWLY SO THE FUEL WILL DRIBBLE OUT
AND SATURATE THE WICK ALL AROUND.

THE WICK IS THEN LIT AND THE DEVICE
IS AIMED AND SQUEEZED. QUICK, HARD
SQUEEZES WILL SQUIRT THE FUEL THROUGH
THE TUBE AND Pe Cd THE BURNING WICK.
THE WICK IGNITES THE FUEL AND YOU HAVE
SUCH A DANDY WEAPON YOU WILL NEVER STOP
BRAGGING! IF YOU HAVE A LITTLE BROTHER,
HE CAN TAKE IT TO SCHOOL FOR SHOW AND
TELL.

GOLD BOX PLANS: COURTESY OF SIR WILLIAM

HOW TO BUILD IT
_______________


     YOU WILL NEED THE FOLLOWING:

TWO 10K OHM AND THREE 1.4K OHM RESISTOR
ES, TWO 2N3904 TRANSISTORS, TWO PHOTOCE
LLS, TWO RED LED'S (THE MORE LIGHT PROD
UCED THE BETTER), A BOX THAT WILL NOT L

 LIGHT FROM THE #1 LED MUST SHING DIREC
TLY ON THE PHOTOCELL #1. THE GOLD BOX I
MAID NEEDED THE TOP OF THE LED'S TO TOU

D IT WILL STILL WORK BUT WHEN SOMEONE P
ICKS THE PHONE UP THEY WILL HEAR A FAIN
T DIAL TONE IN THE BACKGROUND AND MIGHT
 REPORT IT TO THE GESTOPO ER...(AT&T).
1.4K WILL GIVE YOU GOOD RECEPTION WITH
LITTLE RISK OF A GESTOPO AGENT AT YOUR
DOOR.


   NOW THAT YOU HAVE BUILT IT TAKE TWO
GREEN WIRES OF THE SAME LENTH STRIP THE
 ENDS, TWIST TWO ENDS TOGETHER AND CONN
ECT THEM TO GREEN1 AND PLACE A PEICE OF
 TAPE ON IT WITH LINE #1 WRITING ON IT.
 CONTINUE THE PROCESS WITH RED1 ONLY US
E RED WIRE. REPEAT WITH RED2 AND GREEN2
 BUT CHANGE TO LINE #2.





HOW TO INSTALL
______________

   YOU WILL NEED TO FIND TWO PHONE LINE
S THAT ARE CLOSE TOGETHER. LABEL ONE OF
 THE PHONES LINES LINE #1.CUT THE PHONE
 LINES AND TAKE THE OUTER COUTING OFF I
T. THERE SHOULD BE 4 WIRES CUT THE Y CANL
OW AND BLACK WIRES OFF AND STRIP THE RE
D AND GREEN WIRES FOR BOTH LINES.

   LINE #1 SHOULD BE IN TWO PEICES TAKE
 THE GREEN WIRE OF ONE END AND CONNECT
IT TO THE ONE OF THE GREEN WIRES ON THE
 GOLD BOX. TAKE THE OTHER HALF OF LINE #
1 AND HOOK THE FREE GREEN WIRE TO THE G
REEN WIRE ON THE PHONE LINE. REPEAT THE
 PROCESS WITH RED1 AND THE OTHER LINE.

   ALL YOU NEED TO DO NOW IS TO RIGHT D
OWN THE PHONE NUMBERS OF THE PLACE YOU
HOOKED IT UP AT AND GO HOME AND CALL IT
. YOU SHOULD GET A DIAL TONE!!!
IF NOT LEAVE ME A MESSAGE ON THE MODEM
MADNESS BBS 516-569-0589 OR TRY CHANGIN
G THE EMITTER WITH COLLECTOR.
OH AND HOOKING IT UP TO A PAYPHONE IS A
 FEDERAL OFFENCE AND IS ILLEAGAL TO PUT
 ON ANY PHONE.  I RECOMMEND YOU SEE YOU
R LOCAL POLICE DEPARTMENT BEFORE DOING

[THE GREEN BOX : BIOC AGENT 003'S COURSE IN BASIC TELECOMMUNICATIONS/ PART 6]


   The Green Box generates useful tones such as COIN COLLECT, COIN RETURN, and
RINGBACK.  These are the tones that ACTS or the TSPS operator would send to
the CO when appropriate.  Unfortunately, the green box cannot be used at a
fortress station, but must be used by the CALLED party.  The tones (hz) are:

   COIN COLLECT      700  +  1100
   COIN RETURN      1100  +  1700
   RINGBACK          700  +  1700

   Before the called party sends any of these tones, an operator released
signal should be sent to alert the MF detectors at the CO.  This can be done
by sending 900 + 1500 Hz or a single 2600 Hz wink (90 ms) followed by a 60 ms
gap and then the appropriate signal for at least 900 ms.  also, do not forget
that the initial rate is collected shortly before the 3 minute period is up.

   EVERY CITY HAS ONE OR MORE OFFICES DEDICATED TO ASSIGNING NUMBERS TO THE
TELEPHONE WIRE PAIRS.  THESE OFFICES ARE CALLED DPAC OFFICES AND ARE AVAILABLE
TO SERVICE REPS WHO ARE INSTALLING OR REPAIRING PHONES.

     TO GET THE DPAC NUMBER, A SERVICE REP WOULD CALL THE OLD STAND-BY,
CUSTOMER SERVICE NUMBER FOR BILLING INFORMATION IN THE TOWN THE NUMBER THE
PHONE IS LOCATED IN THAT HE IS TRYING TO GET THC UNLISTED NUMBER OF..  OKAY?

     THE CONVERSATION WOULD GO LIKE THIS, 'HI, SAN FRAN THIS IS JOE FROM SAN
MATEO BUVERY,SS OFFICE.  I NEED YOUR DPAC NUMBER FOR THE SOUTH END OF TOWN.'

     THE INFORMATION IS USUALLY PASSED OUT WITH NO HASSLE, IF THE FIRST PERSON
DOES NOT HAVE IT OR IS NOT HELPFUL, TRY ONE FROM A DIFFERENT PREFIX IN THE SAME
CITY.

     THE 'REP' WOULD THEN CALL DPAC (NOTE;  HE WOULD HAVE THE LISTING INFO FROM
HIS OWN DISTRICT; AGAIN HE IS CALLING FROM A NEARBY TOWN).

     ''HI, DEE-PAC THIS IS JOE FROM SAN MATEO PHONE STORE, I NEED THE LISTING
FOR 812 FIRST STREET.''

     THE SAN FRANCISCO WILL THEN GIVE THE NUMBER AT THE ADDRESS REQUESTED.
THERE IS NO NOTATION AT DPAC IF THE NUMBER IS LISTED OR UNLISTED.

     THE DPAC NUMBER FOR S.F. IS, LAST TIME IT WAS CHECKED, (415) 774-8924....

CHARACTERS: CNTRL-O STOPS MASSIVE PRINT-OUTS TO THE SCREEN, BUT LEAVES YOU IN
WHATEVER MODE YOU WERE.  (A TECHNICAL WORD ON WHAT THIS ACTUALLY DOES:  IT
TELLS THE CPU TO IGNORE THE

THIS IS  ABOUT 19200 BAUD, AND SO IT SEEMS LIKE IT JUST CANCELS.)  CNTRL-U
KILLS THE LINE YOU ARE TYPING AT THC TIME.  NOW FOR THE WEIRD ONE:  CNTRL-

   Another  elestial  =lite phile!





For those of you who are sick and

tired of ruining their phone with

white and beige boxes that make

stupid (and now because of ESS,

worthless) tones, there is now an

alternative.  (Thanks to Magnus!)





 How this came about:



Once I was reading and complaining

that there must be a better way to

attach alligator clips to a phun

phone without ruining it and making

it a permanent phone man's set.



I began to contemplate the basic idea

of this new box, when I said, "I just

happen to have a spare modulator and

some phone wire in my phreak kit at

home!"  Immediately I got some

alligator clips.  By the thought I

was thinking, I knew I was up to

something to solve this pain in the

ass problem.


 Construction of the Modu-Box:



You will need:



2 alligator clips

2 lengths of wire

   Preferably red and green about 1/2

   a foot long.

1 phone modulator

   This can be bought (shoplifted!)

   at Radio Shack or other

   electronics stores for not very

   many bucks.  (No bucks if

   shoplifted: the five finger

   discount)  They are simply a

   little beige colored square piece

   of plastic that has a phone jack

   in the front, and when the back is

   taken off, the inside has 4 wires

   ready to hitch up to a phone line.



Symbols:



Y R B G - yellow, red, black, and

          green terminals inside

 - length of red or green wire

      < - alligator clip

           |B|  |G<

           |Y|  |R<

The black and yellow should be left

alone.  (for later use)

Now plug your phone into the jack,

open up the terminal (explained in

the "Terminal Phun" phile), attach

the alligator clips to the bolts

inside, and if you get a dial tone,

then phreak OUT!



If you really want to be a smartass,

you can use the black and yellow also

and make a party line!  (brown box)

    This is a relatively new box,  and all it basically does
is  serve  as a  phone ringer.    You have  two choices  for
ringers, a piezoelectric transducer (ringer),  or a standard
8 ohm speaker.   The speaker has a more pleasant tone to it,
but either will do fine.    This circuit can also be used in
conjunction with a rust box to control an external something
or other  when the  phone  rings.   Just  connect  the 8 ohm
speaker output to the  inputs on  the rust box,  and control
the pot to tune it to light the light (which can be replaced
by a relay for external controlling) when the phone rings.

    SR = --------------------- = ------------ = 6.25 Hz

              DSR = Shift Devider Rate ratio = 128
               f1 = High Output Frequency = 1714

             DEALING WITH THE BAUE & ROUTE OPERATOR


        IT SEEMS THAT FEWER AND FEWER PEOPLE HAVE BLUE BOXES
THESE DAYS, AND THAT IS REALLY TOO BAD.  BLUE BOXES, WHILE NOT
ALL THAT GREAT FOR MAKING FREE CALLS (SINCE THE TPC CAN TELL WHEN
THE CALL WAS MADE, AS WELL AS WHERE IT WAS TOO AND FROM), ARE
REALLY A LOT OF FUN TO PLAY WITH.  SHORT OF BECOMING A REAL LIVE
TSPS OPERATOR, THEY ARE ABOUT THE ONLY WAY YOU CAN REALLY PLAY
WITH THE NETWORK.

        FOR THE FEW OF YOU WITH BLUE BOXES, HERE ARE SOME PHRASES
WHICH MAY MAKE LIFE EASIER WHEN DEALING WITH THE RATE & ROUTE
(R&R) OPERATORS.  TO GET THE R&R OP, YOU SEND A KP + 141 + ST.
IN SOME AREAS YOU MAY NEED TO PUT ANOTHER NPA BEFORE THE 141
(I.E., KP + 213 + 141 + ST), IF YOU HAVE NO LOCAL R&R OPS.

        THE R&R OPERATOR HAS A MYRIAD OF INFORMATION, AND ALL IT
TAKES TO GET THIS DATA IS MUMBLING CRYPTIC PHRASES.  THERE ARE
BASICALLY FOUR SPECIAL PHRASES TO GIVE THE R&R OPS.  THEY ARE
NUMBERS ROUTE, DIRECTORY ROUTE, OPERATOR ROUTE, AND PLACE NAME.

        TO GET AN R&R AN AREA CODE FOR A CITY, ONE CAN CALL THE
R&R OPERATOR AND ASK FOR THE NUMBERS ROUTE.  FOR EXAMPLE, TO FIND
THE AREA CODE FOR CARSON CITY, NEVADA, WE'D ASK THE R&R OP FOR
"CARSON CITY, NEVADA, NUMBERS ROUTE, PLEASE." AND GET THC ANSWER,
"RIGHT... 702 PLUS." MEANING THAT 702 PLUS 7 DIGITS GETS US
THERE.
        SOMETIMES DIRECTORY ASSISTANCE ISN'T JUST NPA + 131. THE
WAY TO GET THESE ROUTINGS IS TO CALL R&R AND ASK FOR "ANAHEIM,
CALIFORNIA, DIRECTORY ROUTE, PLEASE." OF COURSE, SHE'D TELL US IT
WAS 714 PLUS, WHICH MEANS 714 + 131 GETS US THE D.A. OP THERE.
THIS IS SORT OF POINTLESS EXAMPLE, BUT I COULDN'T COME UP WITH A
BETTER ONE ON SHORT NOTICE.

        LET'S SAY YOU WANTED TO FIND OUT HOW TO GET TO THE INWARD
OPERATOR FOR SACREMENTO, CALIFORNIA.  THE FIRST SIX DIGITS OF A
NUMBER IN THAT CITY WILL BE REQUIRED (THE NPA AND AN NXX).  FOR
EXAMPLE, LET US USE 916 756. WE WOULD CALL R&R, AND WHEN THE
OPERATOR ANSWERED, SAY, "916 756, OPERATOR ROUTE, PLEASE." THE
OPERATOR WOULD SAY, "916 PLUS 001 PLUS."  THIS MEANS THAT 916
+ 001 + 121 WILL GET YOU THE INWARD OPERATOR FOR SACRAMENTO. DO
YOU KNOW THE CITY WHICH CORRESPONDS TO 503 640?  THE R&R OPERATOR
DOES, AND WILL TELL YOU THAT IT IS HILLSBORO, OREGON, IF YOU
SWEETLY ASK FOR "PLACE NAME, 503 640, PLEASE."

        FOR EXAMPLE, LET'S SAY YOU NEED THE DIRECTORY ROUTE FOR
SVEG, SWEDEN. SIMPLY CALL R&R, AND ASK FOR, "INTERNATIONAL,
BADEN, SWITZERLAND. TSPS DIRECTORY ROUTE, PLEASE."  IN RESPONSE
TO THIS, YOU'D GET, "RIGHT... DIRECTORY TO SVEG, SWEDEN.  COUNTRY
CODE 46 PLUS 1170."  SO YOU'D ROUTE YOURSELF TO AN
INTERNATIONAL SENDER, AND SEND 46 + 1170 TO GET THE D.A. OPERATOR
IN SWEDEN.

        INWARD OPERATOR ROUTINGS TO VARIOUS COUNTRIES ARE
OBTAINED THE SAME WAY "INTERNATIONAL, LONDON, ENGLAND, TSPS
INWARD ROUTE, PLEASE." AND GET "COUNTRY CODE 44 PLUS 121."
THEREFORE, 44 PLUS 121 GETS YOU INWARD FOR LONDON.
        INWARDS CAN GET YOU LANGUAGE ASSITANCE IF YOU DON'T SPEAK
THE LANGUAGE. TELL THE FOREIGN INWARD, "UNITED STAES CALLING.
LANGUAGE ASSITANCE IN COMPLETING A CALL TO (CALLED PARTY) AT
(CALLED NUMBER)."
        R&R OPERATORS ARE PEOPLE ARE PEOPLE TOO, Y'KNOW.  SO
ALWAYS BE POLITE, MAKE SURE USE OF 'EM, AND DIAL WITH CARE.

NOW, WHAT YOU WILL NEED TO MAKE A PAPER BOMB:

 A CARDBOARD ROLL FROM TOILET PAPER OR FROM A ROLL OF PAPER TOWELS.
 (YOU KNOW, ONE OF THEOSE TUBES THAT YOU LIKE TO BEAT YOUR DOG WITH)
 SOME KLEENEXES
 SOME SMOKELESS GUNPOWDER (YOU CAN FIND IT AT YOUR LOCAL SPORTING GOODS STORE.)
 AND A ROLL OF DUCT TAPE (YOU DONT NEED THE WHOLE THING, JUST USE WHAT YOU NEED
TO AND USE THE REST TO TAPE UP YOUR SHIT HEAD BROTHER)
 AND FINALLY ABOUT 2 FEET OF WATERPROOF FUSE.

NOW WHAT TO DO WITH ALL THIS SHIT:

    TAKE A WAD (ABOUT 3 OR 4) KLEENEXES AND STUFF THE IN ONE END OF THE ROLL.
NOW TAKE THE GUNPOWDER AND  AND POUR IT INTO THE TUBE ABOUT HALF WAY UP.  NOW
TAKE THE FUSE AND STICK IT ALL THE WAY DOWN INTO THE POWDER.   NOW TAKE ANOTHER
WAD OF KLEENEX AND STUFF IT INTO THE END OF THE TUBE WITH THE FUSE STICKING OUT
OF IT.  PUT A SMALL PIECE OF TAPE ONTO THE TUBE TO HOLD THE KLEENEX IN, BUT
KEEP THE TAPE ABOUT 1/2 A CENTIMETER AWAY FROM THE FUSE.  ALSO, MAKE SUX_____E
ARE NO GAPS MORE THAN 1/2 CENTIMETER WIDE ANYWHERE IN THE TUBE.  NOW LIGHT THE
FUSE AND RUN LIKE HELL!

     THESE ARE FUN TO LIGHT AT PARTIES THAT ARE GOING KINDA BAD!  PUT ONE DOWN
THE SINK (NO WATER!) AND LIGHT IT UP!  (MAKE SURE THAT YOU ARE IN SOME GEEKS
HOUSE THAT NO ONE LIKES)  WHAT A RUSH!

     ANOTHER PHUKIN FUN THINGhM DO IS FILL THE TUBE WITH BB'S AND GUN POWDER
OR EVEN SMALL NAILS! TALK ABOUT DESTRUCTION!  TIE IT ON TO YOU'RE DOUCHE BAG
TEACHER'S CHAIR AND LET IT FLY!

Whats is a PBX- Its just like a extender but it can dial alot more places,
overseas,800's,Alliances...ect. If have found them to be MUCH more safer
than using codes.

How to hack one??
PBX's are usely pretty easy to find, most companies hide there PBX's behind
answering machines,vmb's or some other kinda shit. This is my most commonly
used tactic for finding PBX's. Grab a newsweek,time or some mag. with a lot
of advertising and 800 #'s. The best place to find these #'s is in study
hall (If u'r in school). Write them down, go home and dial all of them after
buisness hours. Lets say u dial a 800 and get a answering maching, Start
pounding out tones, the most common keys are the #,0,*.Push one of those
when u get the answering machine, this usely (50% of the time) will take u
to one of the following, a operator, VMS, extension, xtender. WHen using a
PBX u always hit the 9 key for a outside line, so when u enter the VMB or
what ever it maybe hit 9. If u get a dial-tone u'r set to ill. Dial just
like u normally would, 1+ACN, or  alliance (allaince 0700456xxxx,
xxxx=1000,1001,1002,2000, ect.). PBX are really easy to find uld pkeep
venturing around in the 800 # and press 9 every where u go, u'r bound to exfind one somewhere. Dont hang-up if it says its transfering u to the
attendent, some times it is automated and thats where the PBX is hidden.
Please if u have other tactics on hacking PBX go ahead and add'em to this
file..... See u on a ALLIANCE. Later, The Duelist

                              PAYPHONES U.S.A.


By The Commander; Hale Staff Writer


We all know how payphones are direct fun and easy targets for phone phreaks who
enjoy prank calls. It's even a "polite" way of making them, after all, you
aren't waking anyone up at 4am (unless, of course, they have a payphone in
their kitchen), and some of the stupidest people in the world seem to pick
these things up.

Our fun has recently been destroyed by those damned Bell employees armed with
their little red stickers proclaming "Outgoing Calls Only." Well, this series
will aim to come up with the best list possible of payphones not yet protected
by this terrible scam.

Let's cut out the bullshit, and get right to the list. Enjoy them, and be sure
to send the numbers of your local payphones in! (Accurate descriptions of
locations are also nice...)

                                  AT&T
                            The Last Phreak?
                            ----------------
                             Vol. 1 Aug 8-89

   Could it be?  No more Phreaking!!  Yes fellow hackers, after viewing
   this text file you may change your mind all together about the sport of
   phreaking.  AT&T has introduced a new digital phone switch system which
   will revolutionize recognition of calls.  AT&T now has the ability to
   to catch a phreaker as soon as your call hits one of AT&T's many
   switches.  You may have noticed your calls accidentaly being diverted
   to other households.  This is due to the installation of the new AT&T
   digital Switching system.

   With this new system, AT&T will have all calling information up front
   instead of having to call it up from an outer terminal.  All information
   will be displayed and stored in a computer network.  Information such as
   the number you're dialing from, dialing to, time of dial, duration of
   time between each digit dialed ect...  You're instantly CNA'd as soon
   as your call hits the switch (DAMN!).  The information is then stored.

   In our area, this system has just been introduced and will be fully
   installed with in the next month.  After August, most area's will have
   this new digital system installed in every area.  MCI and AT&T are
   currently debating the format of programming on the system.

   You may have noticed the increase in phreakers being caught.  This is
   due to the new system.  Im sure this new system will have its bugs,
   but once it is perfected, there will not be a need for Jeff Dial Tones!!

   This system will give a new name to ANI (Automatic Number
   Identification). This file is not fully accurate, all the info has not
   been completely uncovered. 75% of this 1990 Phreak file has been based
   on fact, 25% on opinion. Watch for Volume II for more info on this
   system. If u have any info that was not mentioned in this file contact
   The Duelist on Jyer Inc.  And if u dont have the # your LAME!!!!!
