Smoke Bombs                         by the Jolly Roger

Here is the recipe for one helluva smoke bomb!

4 parts sugar
6 parts potassium nitrate (Salt Peter)

Heat this mixture over a LOW flame until it melts, stirring well. 
Pour it into a future container and, before it solidifies, imbed a 
few matches into the mixture to use as fuses. One pound of this 
stuff will fill up a whole block with thick, white smoke!
