                            ANARCHY 'N' EXPLOSIVES
                            =====> VOLUME 2 <=====

    This volume defines a few varieties of misc explosives, charges, and
       whatever I had in mind at that time. Anyway, these formulas are not
       as precise in measurements for they were given in brief summary.
       However, they will work, and if used correctly can be safe and "fun".

    FRENCH AMMONAL:
-------------------
            Type: Low Explosive
     Ingredients: 86% Ammonium Nitrate
                   6% Stearic Acid
                   8% Aluminum Powder
     Description: French ammonal is an easily improvised low explosive
                  mixture. It is generally less effective than an equal
                  weight of TNT. The material is loaded by pressing it into
                  a suitable container. Initiation by an Engineer's special
                  blasting cap is recommended.
        Comments: This material was tested. It is effective.
      References: TM 31-201-1, Unconventional Warfare Devices and Techniques,
                  para 1401.

    TETRYTOL:
-------------
            Type: High Explosive
     Ingredients: 75% Tetryl
                  25% TNT
     Description: Tetryol is a high explosive bursting charge. It is used as
                  a demolition explosive, a bursting charge for mines, and
                  in artillery shells. The explosive force of tetrytol is
                  approximately the same as that of TNT. It may be initiated
                  by a blasting cap. Tetrytol is usually loaded by casting.
        Comments: This material was tested. It is effective.

    IMPROVISED PLASTIC EXPLOSIVE FILLER:
----------------------------------------
            Type: High Explosive
     Ingredients: Finely Powdered Potassium Chlorate Cdata  bstals
                  Petroleum Jelly        **MIX THOUROUGHLY**
     Description: This plastic explosive filler can be detonated with a
                  No. 8 commercial blasting cap or with any military
                  blasting cap. The explosive must be stored in a waterproof
                  container until ready to use.
        Comments: This material was tested. It is effective.

    FLAMABILITY OF GASES:
-------------------------
            Type: Gas Explosive
     Ingredients: Explosive Gas
     Description: Under some conditions, common gases act as fuel. When mixed
                  with air, they will burn rapidly or even explode. For some
                  fuel-air mixtures, the range over which the explosion can
                  occur is quite wide while for others the limits are narrow.
                  The upper and lower amounts of common fuels that will cause
                  an ignitable mixture are shown in the table below. The
                  quantity shown is the percentage by volume of air. If the
                  fuel-air mixture is too lean or too rich, it will not
                  ignite. The amounts shown are therefore called limits of
                  inflamability.
                                                   Gases (% by volume of air)
                  Fuel (Gas)                       Lower Limit    Upper Limit
                  -------------------------------  -----------    -----------
                  Water Gas Or Blue Gas                7.0             72
                  Natural Gas                          4.7             15
                  Hydrogen                             4.0             75
                  Acetylene                            2.5             81
                  Propane                              2.2             10
                  Butane                               1.9              9

        Comments: These fuels have been tested under labratory conditions.
                  They are effective. Ignition depends on method of
                  initiation, uniformity of mixture, and physical conditions.
