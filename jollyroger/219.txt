ACSNET
~~~~~~
Australian Computer Science Network (ACSNET), also known as Oz, has its gateway
through the CSNET node munnari.oz.au and if you cannot directly mail to the
oz.au domain, try either username%munnari.oz.au@UUNET.UU.NET or
munnari!username@UUNET.UU.NET.
 
AT&T MAIL
~~~~~~~~~
AT&T Mail is a mailing service of AT&T, probably what you might call it's
MCI-Mail equivalent.  It is available on the UUCP network as node name attmail
but I've had problems having mail get through.  Apparently, it does cost money
to mail to this service and the surrounding nodes are not willing to pick up
the tab for the ingoing mail, or at least, this has seemingly been the case
thus far.  I believe, though, that perhaps routing to att!attmail!user would
work.
 
AT&T recently announced six new X.400 interconnections between AT&T Mail and
electronic mail services in the U.S., Korea, Sweden, Australia, and Finland.
In the U.S., AT&T Mail is now interconnected with Telenet Communications
Corporation's service, Telemail, allowing users of both services to exchange
messages easily.  With the addition of these interconnections, the AT&T Mail
Gateway 400 Service allows AT&T Mail subscribers to exchange messages with
users of the following electronic messaging systems:
 
Company                    E-Mail Name*            Country
-------                    ------------            -------
TeleDelta                  TeDe 400                Sweden
OTC                        MPS400                  Australia
Telecom-Canada             Envoy100                Canada
DACOM                      DACOM MHS               Korea
P&T-Tele                   MailNet 400             Finland
Helsinki Telephone Co.     ELISA                   Finland
Dialcom                    Dialcom                 USA
Telenet                    Telemail                USA
KDD                        Messavia                Japan
Transpac                   ATLAS400                France
 
The interconnections are based on the X.400 standard, a set of guidelines for
the format, delivery and receipt of electronic messages recommended by an
international standards committee the CCITT.  International X.400 messages
incur a surcharge.  They are:
 
                 To Canada:
                    Per note:            $.05
                    Per message unit:    $.10
 
                 To other international locations:
                    Per note:            $.20
                    Per message unit:    $.50
 
There is no surcharge for X.400 messages within the U.S.  The following are
contacts to speak with about mailing through these mentioned networks.  Other
questions can be directed through AT&T Mail's toll-free number, 1-800-624-5672.

CMR
~~~
Previously known as Intermail, the Commercial Mail Relay (CMR) Service is a
mail relay service between the Internet and three commercial electronic mail
systems:  US Sprint/Telenet, MCI-Mail, and DIALCOM systems (i.e. Compmail,
NSFMAIL, and USDA-MAIL).
 
An important note:  The only requirement for using this mail gateway is that
the work conducted must be DARPA sponsored research and other approved
government business.  Basically, this means that unless you've got some
government-related business, you're not supposed to be using this gateway.
Regardless, it would be very difficult for them to screen everything that goes
through their gateway.  Before I understood the requirements of this gateway, I
was sending to a user of MCI-Mail and was not contacted about any problems with
that communication.  Unfortunately, I mistyped the MCI-Mail address on one of
the letters and that letter ended up getting read by system administrators who
then informed me that I was not to be using that system, as well as the fact
that they would like to bill me for using it.  That was an interesting thought
on their part anyway, but do note that using this service does incur charges.
 
The CMR mailbox address in each system corresponds to the label:
 
          Telemail:  [Intermail/USCISI]TELEMAIL/USA
          MCI-Mail:  Intermail      or      107-8239
          CompMail:  Intermail      or      CMP0817
          NSF-Mail:  Intermail      or      NSF153
         USDA-Mail:  Intermail      or      AGS9999
 
Addressing examples for each e-mail system are as follows:
 
MCIMAIL:
   123-4567             seven digit address
   Everett T. Bowens    person's name (must be unique!)
 
COMPMAIL:
   CMP0123              three letters followed by three or four digits
   S.Cooper             initial, then "." and then last name
   134:CMP0123          domain, then ":" and then combination system and
                        account number
 
NSFMAIL:
   NSF0123              three letters followed by three or four digits
   A.Phillips           initial, then "." and then last name
   157:NSF0123          domain, then ":" and then combination system and
                         account number
 
USDAMAIL:
   AGS0123              three letters followed by three or four digits
   P.Shifter            initial, then "." and then last name
   157:AGS0123          domain, then ":" and then combination system and
                         account number
 
TELEMAIL:
   BARNOC               user (directly on Telemail)
   BARNOC/LODH          user/organization (directly on Telemail)
   [BARNOC/LODH]TELEMAIL/USA
                         [user/organization]system branch/country
 
The following are other Telenet system branches/countries that can be mailed
to:
 
TELEMAIL/USA     NASAMAIL/USA     MAIL/USA            TELEMEMO/AUSTRALIA
TELECOM/CANADA   TOMMAIL/CHILE    TMAILUK/GB          ITALMAIL/ITALY
ATI/JAPAN        PIPMAIL/ROC      DGC/USA             FAAMAIL/USA
GSFC/USA         GTEMAIL/USA      TM11/USA            TNET.TELEMAIL/USA
USDA/USA
 
     Note:  OMNET's ScienceNet is on the Telenet system MAIL/USA and to mail to
it, the format would be [A.MAILBOX/OMNET]MAIL/USA.  The following are available
subdivisions of OMNET:
 
         AIR     Atmospheric Sciences
         EARTH   Solid Earth Sciences
         LIFE    Life Sciences
         OCEAN   Ocean Sciences

 NOTE:  You can also mail to username@NASAMAIL.NASA.GOV or
        username@GSFCMAIL.NASA.GOV instead of going through the CMR gateway to
        mail to NASAMAIL or GSFCMAIL.
 
For more information and instructions on how to use CMR, send a message to the
user support group at intermail-request@intermail.isi.edu (you'll get basically
what I've listed plus maybe a bit more).  Please read Chapter 3 of The Future
Transcendent Saga (Limbo to Infinity) for specifics on mailing to these
destination mailing systems.
 
COMPUSERVE
~~~~~~~~~~
CompuServe is well known for its games and conferences.  It does, though, have
mailing capability.  Now, they have developed their own Internet domain, called
COMPUSERVE.COM.  It is relatively new and mail can be routed through either
TUT.CIS.OHIO-STATE.EDU or NORTHWESTERN.ARPA.
 
Example: user%COMPUSERVE.COM@TUT.CIS.OHIO-STATE.EDU or replace
         TUT.CIS.OHIO-STATE.EDU with NORTHWESTERN.ARPA).
 
The CompuServe link appears to be a polled UUCP connection at the gateway
machine.  It is actually managed via a set of shell scripts and a comm utility
called xcomm, which operates via command scripts built on the fly by the shell
scripts during analysis of what jobs exist to go into and out of CompuServe.
 
CompuServe subscriber accounts of the form 7xxxx,yyyy can be addressed as
7xxxx.yyyy@compuserve.com.  CompuServe employees can be addressed by their
usernames in the csi.compuserve.com subdomain.  CIS subscribers write mail to
">inet:user@host.domain" to mail to users on the Wide-Area Networks, where
">gateway:" is CompuServe's internal gateway access syntax.  The gateway
generates fully-RFC-compliant headers.
 
To fully extrapolate -- from the CompuServe side, you would use their EasyPlex
mail system to send mail to someone in BITNET or the Internet.   For example,
to send me mail at my Bitnet id, you would address it to:
 
            INET:C488869%UMCVMB.BITNET@CUNYVM.CUNY.EDU
 
Or to my Internet id:
 
            INET:C488869@UMCVMB.MISSOURI.EDU
 
Now, if you have a BITNET to Internet userid, this is a silly thing to do,
since your connect time to CompuServe costs you money.  However, you can use
this information to let people on CompuServe contact YOU.  CompuServe Customer
Service says that there is no charge to either receive or send a message to the
Internet or BITNET.
 
DASNET
~~~~~~
DASnet is a smaller network that connects to the Wide-Area Networks but charges
for their service.  DASnet subscribers get charged for both mail to users on
other networks AND mail for them from users of other networks.  The following
is a brief description of DASnet, some of which was taken from their
promotional text letter.
 
DASnet allows you to exchange electronic mail with people on more than 20
systems and networks that are interconnected with DASnet.  One of the
drawbacks, though, is that, after being subscribed to these services, you must
then subscribe to DASnet, which is a separate cost.  Members of Wide-Area
networks can subscribe to DASnet too.  Some of the networks and systems
reachable through DASnet include the following:
 
     ABA/net, ATT Mail, BIX (Byte Information eXchange), DASnet Network,
     Dialcom, EIES, EasyLink, Envoy 100, FAX, GeoMail, INET, MCI Mail, NWI,
     PeaceNet/EcoNet, Portal Communications, The Meta Network, The Source,
     Telemail, ATI's Telemail (Japan), Telex, TWICS (Japan), UNISON, UUCP, The
     WELL, and Domains (i.e. ".COM" and ".EDU" etc.).  New systems are added
     all of the time.  As of the writing of this file, Connect, GoverNET,
     MacNET, and The American Institute of Physics PI-MAIL are soon to be
     connected.
 
You can get various accounts on DASnet including:
 
  o  Corporate Accounts -- If your organization wants more than one individual
                           subscription.
  o  Site Subscriptions -- If you want DASnet to link directly to your
                           organization's electronic mail system.
 
To send e-mail through DASnet, you send the message to the DASnet account on
your home system.  You receive e-mail at your mailbox, as you do now.  On the
Wide-Area Networks, you send mail to XB.DAS@STANFORD.BITNET.  On the Subject:
line, you type the DASnet address in brackets and then the username just
outside of them.  The real subject can be expressed after the username
separated by a "!"  (Example:  Subject:  [0756TK]randy!How's Phrack?).
 
The only disadvantage of using DASnet as opposed to Wide-Area networks is the
cost.  Subscription costs as of 3/3/89 cost $4.75 per month or $5.75 per month
for hosts that are outside of the U.S.A.
 
You are also charged for each message that you send.  If you are corresponding
with someone who is not a DASnet subscriber, THEIR MAIL TO YOU is billed to
your account.
 
The following is an abbreviated cost list for mailing to the different services
of DASnet:

  *  The charges given here are to the gateway to the network.  The DASnet
     user is not charged for transmission on the network itself.
 
Subscribers to DASnet get a free DASnet Network Directory as well as a listing
in the directory, and the ability to order optional DASnet services like
auto-porting or DASnet Telex Service which gives you your own Telex number and
answerback for $8.40 a month at this time.

CMR
~~~
Previously known as Intermail, the Commercial Mail Relay (CMR) Service is a
mail relay service between the Internet and three commercial electronic mail
systems:  US Sprint/Telenet, MCI-Mail, and DIALCOM systems (i.e. Compmail,
NSFMAIL, and USDA-MAIL).
 
An important note:  The only requirement for using this mail gateway is that
the work conducted must be DARPA sponsored research and other approved
government business.  Basically, this means that unless you've got some
government-related business, you're not supposed to be using this gateway.
Regardless, it would be very difficult for them to screen everything that goes
through their gateway.  Before I understood the requirements of this gateway, I
was sending to a user of MCI-Mail and was not contacted about any problems with
that communication.  Unfortunately, I mistyped the MCI-Mail address on one of
the letters and that letter ended up getting read by system administrators who
then informed me that I was not to be using that system, as well as the fact
that they would like to bill me for using it.  That was an interesting thought
on their part anyway, but do note that using this service does incur charges.
 
The CMR mailbox address in each system corresponds to the label:
 
          Telemail:  [Intermail/USCISI]TELEMAIL/USA
          MCI-Mail:  Intermail      or      107-8239
          CompMail:  Intermail      or      CMP0817
          NSF-Mail:  Intermail      or      NSF153
         USDA-Mail:  Intermail      or      AGS9999
 
Addressing examples for each e-mail system are as follows:
 
MCIMAIL:
   123-4567             seven digit address
   Everett T. Bowens    person's name (must be unique!)
 
COMPMAIL:
   CMP0123              three letters followed by three or four digits
   S.Cooper             initial, then "." and then last name
   134:CMP0123          domain, then ":" and then combination system and
                        account number
 
NSFMAIL:
   NSF0123              three letters followed by three or four digits
   A.Phillips           initial, then "." and then last name
   157:NSF0123          domain, then ":" and then combination system and
                         account number
 
USDAMAIL:
   AGS0123              three letters followed by three or four digits
   P.Shifter            initial, then "." and then last name
   157:AGS0123          domain, then ":" and then combination system and
                         account number
 
TELEMAIL:
   BARNOC               user (directly on Telemail)
   BARNOC/LODH          user/organization (directly on Telemail)
   [BARNOC/LODH]TELEMAIL/USA
                         [user/organization]system branch/country
 
The following are other Telenet system branches/countries that can be mailed
to:
 
TELEMAIL/USA     NASAMAIL/USA     MAIL/USA            TELEMEMO/AUSTRALIA
TELECOM/CANADA   TOMMAIL/CHILE    TMAILUK/GB          ITALMAIL/ITALY

GSFC/USA         GTEMAIL/USA      TM11/USA            TNET.TELEMAIL/USA
USDA/USA
 
     Note:  OMNET's ScienceNet is on the Telenet system MAIL/USA and to mail to
it, the format would be [A.MAILBOX/OMNET]MAIL/USA.  The following are available
subdivisions of OMNET:
 
         AIR     Atmospheric Sciences
         EARTH   Solid Earth Sciences

 NOTE:  You can also mail to username@NASAMAIL.NASA.GOV or
        username@GSFCMAIL.NASA.GOV instead of going through the CMR gateway to
        mail to NASAMAIL or GSFCMAIL.
 
For more information and instructions on how to use CMR, send a message to the
user support group at intermail-request@intermail.isi.edu (you'll get basically
what I've listed plus maybe a bit more).  Please read Chapter 3 of The Future
Transcendent Saga (Limbo to Infinity) for specifics on mailing to these
destination mailing systems.
 
COMPUSERVE
~~~~~~~~~~
CompuServe is well known for its games and conferences.  It does, though, have
mailing capability.  Now, they have developed their own Internet domain, called
COMPUSERVE.COM.  It is relatively new and mail can be routed through either
TUT.CIS.OHIO-STATE.EDU or NORTHWESTERN.ARPA.
 
Example: user%COMPUSERVE.COM@TUT.CIS.OHIO-STATE.EDU or replace
         TUT.CIS.OHIO-STATE.EDU with NORTHWESTERN.ARPA).
 
The CompuServe link appears to be a polled UUCP connection at the gateway
machine.  It is actually managed via a set of shell scripts and a comm utility
called xcomm, which operates via command scripts built on the fly by the shell
scripts during analysis of what jobs exist to go into and out of CompuServe.
 
CompuServe subscriber accounts of the form 7xxxx,yyyy can be addressed as
7xxxx.yyyy@compuserve.com.  CompuServe employees can be addressed by their
usernames in the csi.compuserve.com subdomain.  CIS subscribers write mail to
">inet:user@host.domain" to mail to users on the Wide-Area Networks, where
">gateway:" is CompuServe's internal gateway access syntax.  The gateway
generates fully-RFC-compliant headers.
 
To fully extrapolate -- from the CompuServe side, you would use their EasyPlex
mail system to send mail to someone in BITNET or the Internet.   For example,
to send me mail at my Bitnet id, you would address it to:
 
            INET:C488869%UMCVMB.BITNET@CUNYVM.CUNY.EDU
 
Or to my Internet id:
 
            INET:C488869@UMCVMB.MISSOURI.EDU
 
Now, if you have a BITNET to Internet userid, this is a silly thing to do,
since your connect time to CompuServe costs you money.  However, you can use
this information to let people on CompuServe contact YOU.  CompuServe Customer
Service says that there is no charge to either receive or send a message to the
Internet or BITNET.
 
DASNET
~~~~~~
DASnet is a smaller network that connects to the Wide-Area Networks but charges
for their service.  DASnet subscribers get charged for both mail to users on
other networks AND mail for them from users of other networks.  The following
is a brief description of DASnet, some of which was taken from their
promotional text letter.
 
DASnet allows you to exchange electronic mail with people on more than 20
systems and networks that are interconnected with DASnet.  One of the
drawbacks, though, is that, after being subscribed to these services, you must
then subscribe to DASnet, which is a separate cost.  Members of Wide-Area
networks can subscribe to DASnet too.  Some of the networks and systems
reachable through DASnet include the following:
 
     ABA/net, ATT Mail, BIX (Byte Information eXchange), DASnet Network,
     Dialcom, EIES, EasyLink, Envoy 100, FAX, GeoMail, INET, MCI Mail, NWI,
     PeaceNet/EcoNet, Portal Communications, The Meta Network, The Source,
     Telemail, ATI's Telemail (Japan), Telex, TWICS (Japan), UNISON, UUCP, The
     WELL, and Domains (i.e. ".COM" and ".EDU" etc.).  New systems are added
     all of the time.  As of the writing of this file, Connect, GoverNET,
     MacNET, and The American Institute of Physics PI-MAIL are soon to be
     connected.
 
You can get various accounts on DASnet including:
 
  o  Corporate Accounts -- If your organization wants more than one individual
                           subscription.
  o  Site Subscriptions -- If you want DASnet to link directly to your
             SAGE **
