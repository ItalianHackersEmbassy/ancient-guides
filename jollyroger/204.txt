                           Raggers and Braggers                           
==========================================================================
   This section is to make  you aware  of well-known raggers and braggers.
Since this is  the first time this  section is being printed, we will tell
you what classifies people as raggers and braggers.  In  the future issues
the top raggers and braggers will be  listed in this newsletter to let the
SysOps  know who not to let on their board, or to  atleast keep an eye on.
   A ragger is someone who will put someone else  down for something.  The
person might post a message  asking a novice  question  about hacking  and
phreaking, or may  say  something  that is completely wrong, and a  ragger
will  put the  other person  down for he said, posted, etc.  The ones that
usually classify in this category are the ones that think they know it all
and consider themselves right  no matter  what anyone  says.  Most  of the
users that  use codes and  consider  themselves a  master phreaker usually
become raggers.                                                         
   A bragger is someone who either does or thinks he does know everything,
and puts it upon himself to tell  the  whole  world that he  knows it all.
This  person is also  one who thinks he is better  than  everyone else and
he believes he is Elite, and no one else is.  People  who tend to  do this
are those who have, for some reason, become well-known in the  underworld,
and as  a result become a bragger.  Those  usually not too well-known will
not tend  to brag as  much as  those who think  everyone would  love to be
their friend and be like them.                         
   As a well-known ragger and  bragger, The Toad, learned that it does not
help to be one or both of those.  He  has since  changed and is now easily
accepted by  most.  Most people  disliked him because others they knew had
said something bad about him.  This  is called peer pressure and  is a bad
influence to those who  are new to the underworld.  I would suggest in the
future,  to not judge someone by what others  say, but rather by  how they
act around/to you. 
   The current  most  popular Atarian  that  classifies as a  ragger and a
bragger is Ace of Aces, and  is well-hated by many users and SysOps, since
he tends to put  down anything anyone  says and considers himself the best
at writing hacking programs.  He is commonly  referred to as  Ass of Asses
and Ass of Assholes.  Even holding an open  mind about this guy, you would
soon come to find that what others said  coincides  with what you see from
him.                                                                      
==========================================================================
                          A New 950 has arrived!                          
==========================================================================
   LDDS, who as  mentioned above bought out TMC, is  installing  a new 950
port to most major  cities.  By the time  you read  this, it should  be in
almost every area that supports 950 ports.  The number is  950-1450.  This
port will dial 976 numbers, but not 700, 800, or 900 numbers.  The dialing
method  for LDDS is:  7 digit code, then  even if the code is  bad it will
give you a dial tone.  Then  dial the area  code  plus the number.  If you
have a bad code it will simply say your call cannot be completed as it was
dialed.  There is a default code used on the system that  currently works.
The code is simply, 1234567.  I have seen codes from 5 different companies
and they all are in the format of 00xxxxx.  I do  not  know  what  type of
software they use, but I  will  know by  the next  issue exactly what they
place  on  the bills.  This  could  be  the  answer  to  alot  of people's
problems with fear of Sprint and ITT, especially  AllNets.  Just remember,
Tracker  is the one  who  found  this, and all  information  about it.  If
someone  is seen saying  they found  this, then they will be listed in the
next issue which will contain an article on leeches.

                             Mailbox Systems                              
==========================================================================
   Mailbox systems are the link between information and the underworld. If
you have ever called one, then you will know the advantages of having one,
especially the ones that are  open to whole underworld, rather than just a
select few.  There are two types  of mailbox systems that are widely used.
   The first  type we will  talk about is the multiple mailbox systems, or
commonly referred to  as  message  systems.  These  systems  have several
mailboxes set up on one number.  Usually, you  can access other  mailboxes
from that  number  by  pressing '*' or '#'.  Sometimes you  just enter the
mailbox number and you are connected.  These are the safest systems to use
to protect information from US Sprint and other  long distance  companies.
Since US Sprint and other companies  call  the destination  numbers, it is
safer to  have 800 mailbox systems, and  most  of  the time, the  multiple
mailbox systems  are on 800 numbers.  The  passcode on  these  systems can
vary in length and can be accessed by several  different methods, so it is
impossible to explain exactly how to hack these systems.                  
   The other type is the single mailbox system.  These  are usually set up
in a reserved  prefix in an area  code.  (Ex: 713-684-6xxx)  These systems
are usually  controlled by the  same type of hardware/software.  To access
the area  where you  enter the  passcode, just hit '0' for a second or so.
The passcodes are  four (4)  digits  long.  The only way to hack  these is
manually.  The best thing you could do is to  find one that does not  have
a recording from a person, but just the  digitized voice.  If you hack one
that  someone already  owns, they will  report it and  it will not last as
long.                                                                     
   Here is a list mailboxes or prefixes to help you get started
