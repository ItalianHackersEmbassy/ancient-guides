Intro
~~~~~
   Welcome all you mercinaries to be, sorry about the wait for this issue
but I've been having problems of a personal nature (basically I got busted
for some things). I'm planning on having Mercinary Today 10 out by September
and it will be the aniversary issue. It is going to ROCK, I've got LOTS in
store for that one!!

* The Art of Gassing *
**********************
   The best gases are the simple ones to make. Such as Clorine, hydrogen 
(doesn't really suffocate anyone but if they light a match you'll have fun)
Carbon Dioxide, Carbon Monoxide, Most of the Oxides of Nitrogen and florine
dioxide. Most of these (with the exception of hydrogen) suffocate your enemy
and some even torch their lungs :). Most are readily available (except for
florine dioxide) and some you can even make like Clorine (be CAREFUL!) all
ya do is mix ammonia and bleach. (a little reminder DO NOT MAKE INDOORS)
   
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
^ Choosing a good Knife  ^
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
   The best knives to have are called balistic knives, basically what they
do is when you pull the pin the blade shoots (YES, shoots!) a effective
range of 25-30 feet. Unfortunately, anyone who lives in Canada gets caught
even carrying something like this, gets a few free nights in jail. But fear
not, there are a group of fairly good knives that spring open quick and are
almost invisible at night. These are the Spyderco series of knives (no I'm
not a sales rep for them), they come in a flat black finish which is on the
blade as well as the handle and are simple to open one handed. They come
in a variety of sizes from the ladybug model to the rather large endura model
(which I happen to own myself) the only thing that you can actually see
(I mean it is reflective) is 2 pins on the handle (which your hand should be
on anywayz) and the edge on the blade (which is only visible on one side).
These and excellent knives and are VERY tough.
************************************
* How to Choose a Get-Away Vehicle *
************************************
   Choosing a get-away vehicle is fairly easy and ya do is find a fairly
common vehicle that is fairly fast and not too conspicuous (BTW, Don't use
a stolen vehicle borrow it from a friend or something). Then, you look around
in parking lots for a car that looks like the one you have (I mean exact)
then you steal their liscence plates, chances are they won't report it.
Then, you put them on your get-away car (remembering to keep your old ones
with you), do your business then drive away replace the plates and throw the
lifted plates in a dumpster somewhere. And there you have it. You lessen your
chances of getting caught and it didn't cost you any thing.
