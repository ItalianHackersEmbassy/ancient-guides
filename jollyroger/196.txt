      Try this sometime when you are bored!

      1) Take one pound of raw peanuts (not roasted!)

      2) Shell them, saving the skins and discarding the shells.

      3) Eat the nuts.

      4) Grind up the skins and roll them into a cigarette, and smoke!

      You'll have fun, believe me! -------------RFLAGG-----------
