Procedure:
---------

CAUTION: Make sure that ther are no open flames in the area when mixing 
flame fuels! NO SMOKING!!

1) Seperate the egg white from the yolk. This can be done by breaking the 
egg into a dish and carefully removing the yolk with a spoon.
2) Pour egg white into a jar, bottle, or other container, and add gasoline.
3) Add the salt (or other additive) to the mixture and stir occasionally 
until gel forms (about 5 to 10 minutes).

NOTE: A thicker gelled flame fuel can be obtained by putting the capped jar 
in hot (65 degrees Centegrade) water for about 1/2 hour and then letting 
them cool to room temperature. (DO NOT HEAT THE GELLED FUEL CONTAINING 
COFFEE!!)
