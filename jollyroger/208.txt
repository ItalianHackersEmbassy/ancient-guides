                            ==> PRELUDE VOLUME <==

   For you people that like blowing things up and shit like that, here's
 something that's not as dangerous or as difficult as more of the explosives
 available (or able to create)... It's called the LN2 Bomb (Short for Liquid
 Nitrogen Bomb). Very easy to make:

         Ingredients:     1 Plastic Two Litre Bottle
                            Enough Liquid Nitrogen To Fill The Bottle

         Instructions:    Fill the bottle with liquid nitrogen. Then cap
                          as tightly as possible. The vaporization of the
                          nitrogen will create enough pressure in the
                          bottle (within 5-15 minutes) to break it with
                          a quite strong explosive force... Very Easy...

                        USE AT YOUR OWN RISK....

                   TOXIC RELEASE INVENTORY REPORTING CENTER

EPA has established a reading room in the  Toxic  Inventory  Reporting  Center
(TRC) located at 470 L'Enfant Plaza East,  S.W.,  Suite 7103, Washington, D.C.
20024.  The reading room provides a place for  concerned  citizens  to  review
release  data  as  supplied  to  the  Environmental Protection Agency (through
section 313 reporting).  To date,  the center has received more than 50,000 of
the 300,000 release reports anticipated.

The TRC's is intended to serve as a central receipt point,  aid in the sorting
recording and storage of release data reported under Title  III.  Additionally
the  TRC  is to provide an easy method to facilitate public inquiries.  Anyone
can access the chemical information by logging onto a data  base  and  calling
the information up by using CAS number, state, city and/or facility name.

Staff from Computer Based Systems, Inc. (EPA contractor) are on-hand to assist
with  system inquiries between 8:00 am and 4:00 pm, Monday through Friday.  To

CHEMTREC: 1-(800) 424-9300.  Alaska, Hawaii and DC (202) 483-7616
Contact:  Chemical  Manufacturers  Association
          2501 M Street, N.W.
          Washington, D.C. 20037.

The Chemical Manufacturers Association  set  up  the  Chemical  Transportation
Emergency  Center  (CHEMTREC)  to provide immediate assistance to those at the
scene of accident,  24 hours a day,  seven days a week.  CHEMTREC maintains an
online  database on the chemical,  physical,  and toxicological properties and
health effects of the thousands of products of the member companies.  CHEMTREC
operates in two stages:  first,  staff provide chemical information for use in
onsite  decisionmaking involving handling the early stages of the problem and,
second,  notifies the manufacturer of the product of  the  accident  for  more
detailed  information  and  appropriate  follow-up.

CHEMNET  is  activated  by  a  call  to  CHEMTREC.  If a member shipper cannot
respond promptly to an incident and a chemical expert is required at  a  site,
then the shipper can authorize a CHEMNET-contracted emergency response company
to go in its place.

The  Chlorine  Institute  in  1972  established  its  Chlorine  Emergency Plan
(CHLOREP),  a  mutual-aid  response  network  of  chlorine  manufacturers  and
packagers,  to provide assistance at chlorine emergencies in the United States
and Canada  through  telephone  instructions  to  on-scene  personnel  or  the
dispatching  of  trained  teams  to sites.  Response is activated by a call to
CHEMTREC which in turn calls the designated CHLOREP contact,  who notifies the
appropriate   team  leader  based  upon  CHLOREP's  geographical  sector  team
assignments.

The Office of Solid Waste and Emergency Response  (OSWER)  bulletin  board  is
intended  to  to  ts orr  communications and technology transfer among the Regions
and with Headquarters staff involved in solid or hazardous  waste  regulation,
permitting,   or   enforcement  and  with  ORD  scientists  and  engineers  in
Headquarters and laboratories who are supporting OSWER.  The OWSER is operated
under contract to the Office of  Program  Management  Technology  (OPMT).  The
OSWER BBS offers messages,  bulletins, files and computer programs, databases,
and conferences.  Bulletins include OSWER technical training opportunities and
ORD technology transfer seminars nationwide,  new ORD technical  publications,
the  top 25 compounds found at Superfund Sites,  and the current status of the
SITE  technology  demonstrations.   Conferences  include:  Executive (for  EPA
managers  only),   Ground-Water   Workstation,   Ground-Water  Monitoring  and
Remediation,   Risk  Management/Assessment,   and  Expert   Systems/Geographic
Information  Systems.   The  BBS  is  primarily  intended  for  EPA  Regional,
Headquarters,  and ORD personnel,  however,  OSWER welcomes  state  and  local
government  agencies and authorized EPA contractors.  The BBS telephone number

The Hazardous Materials Information  Systems  (HMIS)  offers  two  menu-driven
programs to assist state, local and Federal agencies.  The U.S.  Department of
Transportation  (DOT),  Research  and Special Programs Administration's (RSPA)
project offers quick  access  to  both  exemptions  information  and  informal
interpretations.  The  exemptions  menu  provides  access  to  the  following:
exemption numbers, exemption holders, expiration dates, container type and DOT
specification,  hazardous material,  shipping name and class,  and regulations
affected.    The    interpretations   menu   provides   access   to   informal
interpretations  issued  by  the  Standards  Division,   Office  of  Hazardous
Materials   Transportation.   Each   search  provides:   requestor,   subject,
commodity,  container and regulations affected.  This service is provided FREE
to  state,  local,  and federal agencies.  Private sector organizations cannot
get an account on the HMIS but can call to receive  printouts  on  information
they  need  (there is a fee for the printout).  In order to gain access to the
HMIS you must FIRST ESTABLISH AN ACCOUNT by contacting:
