The easiest way to hotwire cars                 by the Jolly Roger

Get in the car. Look under the dash. If it enclosed, forget it 
unless you want to cut through it. If you do, do it near the 
ignition. Once you get behind or near the ignition look for two 
red wires. In older cars red was the standard color, if not, look 
for two matched pairs. When you find them, cross them and take 
off!
