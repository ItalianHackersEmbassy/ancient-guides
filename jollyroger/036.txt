How to Make Dynamite                            by The Jolly Roger

Dynamite is nothing more than just nitroglycerin and a stablizing
agent to make it much safer to use.  For the sake of saving time, I
will abbreviate nitroglycerin with a plain NG.  The numbers
are percentages, be sure to mix these carefully and be sure to use the
exact amounts.  These percentages are in weight ratio, not volume.

sold under brand names, or have household equivalants.  here is a list
that might help you out. Also, see elsewhere in this Cookbook for 
a more complete listing............

Keep this list handy at all times. If you can't seem to get one
or more of the ingredients try another one.  If you still can't, you
can always buy small amounts from your school, or maybe from various
chemical companies.  When you do that, be sure to say as little as
possible, if during the school year, and they ask, say it's for a
experiment for school.
