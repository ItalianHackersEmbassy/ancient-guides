Fuses                             by The Jolly Roger

You would be surprised how many files are out there that use what 
falls under the category of a "fuse." They assume that you just 
have a few lying around, or know where to get them. Well, in some 
parts of the country, fuses are extremely hard to come by... so 
this file tells you how to make your own. Both fuses presented 
here are fairly simple to make, and are fairly reliable.
